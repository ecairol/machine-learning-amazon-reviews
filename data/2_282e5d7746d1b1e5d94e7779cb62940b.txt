UPDATED: Great Warranty Claim Experience!
EDITED 11/26/2015:  Great response and help from ASUS on a warranty claim for the keyboard going out.  Sent back for repairs, returned very quickly and it works great.  Very happy with the whole process and how helpful and easy the warranty claim process was.My original post: The numeric keys no longer work or are spotty at best - very disappointing!  I will contact ASUS and see if this is covered under warranty.  I'll update my rating after working with ASUS.
