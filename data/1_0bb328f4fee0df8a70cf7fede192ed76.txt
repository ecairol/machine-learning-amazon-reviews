Thankfully Amazon was awesome and replaced this for me
There were some glitches with my original computer, as it wouldn't let me type in google docs. Thankfully Amazon was awesome and replaced this for me. Overall its a light, fast computer, good for basics of google drive. Downside is that you need an internet connection.
