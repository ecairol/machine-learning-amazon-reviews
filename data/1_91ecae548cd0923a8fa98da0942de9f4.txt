I love this thing!
I love my new ipad air!  I mostly have PC or android products so had to be convinced to purchase an apple tablet.  The ipad air is perfect!  It's paper thin and light-weight, lightening fast, easy to use and navigate, has a super sharp screen image, wi-fi works great. There are so many apps for the ipad and they work seamlessly.  I downloaded the kindle app because I read lots of e-books; it works perfectly!  I debated whether to get the smaller ipad mini (easier to hold device for reading) or the larger ipad air; I'm glad I got the larger screen - easier to use for web browsing and not that difficult for reading books.  The Safari browser works great too and easy to save weblinks.  The battery lasts all day with moderate use but needs to be charged every night (I think this is standard for tablets).  The only negative - my husbands wants to use it too :-)
