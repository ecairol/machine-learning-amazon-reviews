Won't power up after three days
Got my zenbook three days ago, was really impressed with the built quality and look, but it all of a sudden wouldn't power up today, called the Asus support and they determined that it has to be shipped back for service but I may get a refurbished unit as replacement. I researched online and found this to be uncommon that opening up the chassis and reset the battery connection may fix it. I didn't go that route as that would have voided the warranty. There is a reason why Apple product costs twice as much, you got what you paid for. :(
