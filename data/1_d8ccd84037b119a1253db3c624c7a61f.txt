ZenBook - a great choice for an ultrabook
I am primarily a Linux OS user.  In my consulting work, I had to use some of the Microsoft products and was in search of a light ultrabook to carry with me on trips to client locations.  This is an excellent device to carry around - extremely light.  It has no fans.  I use it primarily for Visio Professional, and Office type documents (WORD, EXCEL, PowerPoint) in LibreOffice (highly recommend).  It book extremely fast - comparable to my Chromebook.  I have not timed it but in a matter of a few seconds it is ready to perform work.  The usb 3 ports are extremely fast also.  I do most of my work from a usb 3 flash drive.  I have purchased a micro-hdmi to DVI cable to connect it to devices for presentation.  It is very sharp.  I uninstalled the anti-virus that came with it and installed AVG (again I highly recommend).  I don't have any negatives about the device - it does exactly what I wanted extremely fast.  I have had the Zenbook about a month and am very pleased with the purchase.
