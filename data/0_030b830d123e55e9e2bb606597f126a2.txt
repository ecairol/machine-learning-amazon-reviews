Don't buy this laptop until Dell fixes the touchpad problem. They have designed and built a remarkable laptop in the new XPS 13 Ultrabook and fumbled the ball before they crossed the goal line. The computer is almost unusable because of it's main input peripheral device. The precision (?) touchpad. The internet is full of consumers who are experiencing the same problem and yet no fix has been announced by Dell that I can see. I hope they get their act together and fix this problem because they really could have a winner product if it  wasn't crippled like it is. Your customer base won't wait forever Dell. Those that can will return their purchase and new and new prospects look elsewhere.
