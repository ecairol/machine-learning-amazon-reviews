... the actual dvd port so I am not that satisfied
i really don't understand the point in putting in the dvd tray if the laptop doesn't have the actual dvd trap or the program for it cause I would've ever bought this model of laptop if I would've realized it didn't have the actual dvd port so I am not that satisfied
