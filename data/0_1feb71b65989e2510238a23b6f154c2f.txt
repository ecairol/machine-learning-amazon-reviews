good if your broke
The computer cam quickly and I was excited to open the box but my excitment turned to disapoitment as soon as I pick it up it feels like a cheap toy it's decent for processing but the screen graffix afeel like the old tube t.v. I can't look at it for to long before getting a headache. the ports are nice to have but I won't be using this computer much. I will keep using my Asus tablet that performs better and cost less
