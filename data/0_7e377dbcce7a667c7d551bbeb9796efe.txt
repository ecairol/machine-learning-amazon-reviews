Alpha-ready at best
I hate this device. I wouldn't even call it beta, it's early alpha...Suddenly - without any apparent reason - my Hisense Pulse started to display Force Close dialog on Home screen. Clicking OK just opens the same modal dialog again and again. I can quickly hit Netflix, or YouTube, or LiveTV buttons - corresponding apps are working fine. But closing them returns to Home screen - to the same modal Force Close dialog. No way to go to Settings screen to try to clean data, etc.I suppose the only possibility other than returning device for a warranty replacement is to do a full hardware reset. But I don't understand how to press reset button. I tried to insert a pin inside and press - nothing happens.I hate this device. It's not only absolutely not consumer ready, it's hardly qualifies as a beta, I'd say - alpha version.[...][...]
