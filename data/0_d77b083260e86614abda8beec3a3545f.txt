Short lived, not worth your money
It worked pretty well for a little less than a year. It randomly got itself into a start up loop one day, and I had to reset it to factory settings. Now the battery won't work unless plugged in, and it never gets past the first start up screen. I can't even get to the Windows start up screen anymore.
