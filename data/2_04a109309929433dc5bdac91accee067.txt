I like this laptop a ton
So far, I like this laptop a ton.  Lasts a long time as far as battery goes, keyboard/ touchpad shortcuts are cool, and I haven't felt the need to switch over to linux yet.  Then again, pretty much all I've used it for so far is some pokemon showdown, watching anime, and adding some pretty good extensions.
