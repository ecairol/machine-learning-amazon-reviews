Great Bang for your Buck!!
This laptop is a fantastic ultra-portable device for casual use. I can take it out with me for the whole day without worrying about it running out of battery (about 7 hours SOT). For ASUS' first shot with the intel core m series CPU, they really seemed to have proven that this laptop is the best bang for your buck! While it's not perfect, I like it much more than other ultra portables with gimped RAM or tiny SSD's. Here's some of the things I would like to share about my experience with it so far:Pros:- Great Battery Life- Good for outside use (bright backlight and anti-glare screen)- 8gb RAM should be a minimum standard these days, thanks ASUS.- Decent travel for keys so short- 256gb SSD on the BASE model, bravo ASUS.- 3 USB ports- fanless, so no noise whatsoeverCons:- track pad is usable, but not as responsive as I'd like- gets hot on cloth surfaces- a lot of annoying ASUS bloat preinstalled- no backlit keys
