Wish I'd received a fully working unit
Wish I received one of the fully operational units! I am sure I would have rated it as 5 star had I not received defective units. I'm told by someone who used to retail and troubleshoot laptops that ASUS (like some other manufacturers) has some defective units in some of their production batches, and that is to be expected with the units being produced so quickly. Well, unfortunately I received one of those defective units -- the Wifi component has a problem, perhaps not properly installed, so right out of the box, the unit indicated that my Wifi/internet signal was "out of range" -- even when I moved right next to the signal source. All of our other devices worked, so it was not because of some temporary wifi problem. I tried again 2 hours later -- same thing. And same thing when I tried another network. (And yes, the network passcodes were keyed correctly.) This unit was to replace the first C201 I received. That one (am using it now) works well except that it's getting not much more than 1/2 the advertised battery life and crashes a few times a day and randomly doesn't recognize when a USB thumb drive is inserted -- which the nice Amazon rep and I thought might be related to improper packing -- an oversized box was used with no packing material, so the unit was dislodged from within its fitted ASUS packaging.
