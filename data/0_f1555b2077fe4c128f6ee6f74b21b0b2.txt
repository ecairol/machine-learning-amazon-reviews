First I want to say that this is a beautiful piece of equipment
First I want to say that this is a beautiful piece of equipment. It has nice little touches with the carbon fiber around the keyboard and the aluminum cover. It's a well designed laptop that's very light and even though they shrank the size the keys don't feel crammed together.However, the touch pad is terrible, and the keyboard consistently registers multiple touches. I've spent 4 months with Dell's customer service and had two touch pad replacements to no avail. At this point I can't type on it and I can't use the touch pad, so it's basically a pretty doorstop. Dell's customer service just keeps reinstalling drivers and reinstalling the operating system hoping that'll fix the problem but after 4 months and still the same story it's just a faulty device. My last call with customer service the rep told me that the problem was on my end and that I didn't know how to use a touch pad or a keyboard, although the internet is full of people with the same problems. This will be my last Dell purchase in my lifetime.
