A laptop that is thin, attractive and very useful.
The laptop immediately set itself up with  some questions to the user, was able to quick add programs and needs for my business travels like the manner it handles.  Read many reviews about this laptop and for the most part it sold me on getting this ultra size and weight for my personal and business needs.  The mouse pad comments read about worked well for me and sensitive to movements correctly.  There are more review that are more technical and read those and more independently on the internet for the most part this product sold me and expect it to do well as I travel.  There is no perfect machine but this one is very close.
