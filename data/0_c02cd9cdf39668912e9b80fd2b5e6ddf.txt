Touchpad barely functioned straight out of the box
This was my fifth Chromebook.  I have had two Samsungs then two Acers.  I switched to Acer simply because the Samsung was made of really cheap plastic. Otherwise, I have never had any problems with any Chromebooks. Because of the positive reviews, I can accept that I maybe just got a defective one, but the touch pad does not work. Scrolling is nearly impossible, even clicking seven or eight times results in no action and forget about highlighting to copy and paste or cut a sentence. A few other related kinks.  I am very experienced with these Chromebooks so I know it isn't me. I also find this one to operate at a much slower speed.  I don't know why.  Again, maybe I just got a defect, but it is a bad enough defect that I am sending this one back and will return to Acer or maybe check out some of the new ones offered by other brands. If you have never had a single issue with a Chromebook, and then get one that doesn't work out of the box, it is enough to make you just pass on that brand altogether.
