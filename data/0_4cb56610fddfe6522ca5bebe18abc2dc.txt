Terrible customer service and terrible product
If you are considering a new TV or electronics, stay away from VIZIO.  Last night, our smart screen had a pixel blow in the middle and crack the screen from the inside.  There is nothing on the outside of the tv.  Bought the TV back in November.  After several calls back and forth with customer service today, I was told at 6:00 pm they were sending us a new TV.  Got a call back at 8:30 pm saying that it wasn't covered so we were out of luck.  They won't back down even though they had already said they were sending a replacement.  We have had several issues with this TV before this but this beats it all.  The remote is terrible.  It doesn't work half the time and you have to take the batteries out and reset it to get it to work.  This summer, the TV itself started freezing up. We would have to unplug the tv and discharge all the power to get it to work. The screen breaks on its own during the warranty time and we are out of luck even though they initially said they were replacing it. Terrible product and service.  Will never buy another Vizio again.  Stay far away.
