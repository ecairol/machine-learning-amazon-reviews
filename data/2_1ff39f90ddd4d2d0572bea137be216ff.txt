Beauty Meets Efficiency
Everything I wanted! I read hundreds of reviews before making this purchase.  I wanted a laptop that was sleek, light weight, and efficient.  I use it for research, school work, communication, and coding for data analysis.  It performs wonderfully for all of these tasks.  Read previous reviews for very detailed information.  The only thing I wish it had that it doesn't is a scroll option on the touchpad.
