Won't even work as a paperweight
Great looking and lightweight. The power "brick" is so compact that I can shove it in my 14' laptop sleeve and it's totally fine.  I have experienced the lag  when using multiple tabs that I read about in multiple reviews, but since this is really just for me to carry around and perform basic functions, I have no major complaints. I think this is a great machine for kids or folks who just need a computer because everybody says that they do, lol. For the price, you can't beat it. Don't expect too much, but don't underestimate it either. Oh, and be prepared to use the Google app store, as many Windows, Mac, and Linux-based apps won't work on this little baby.  Update: It has turned on me. All of the sudden, the chromebook began randomly informing me that my password couldn't be verified. When I entered my old gmail password, the computer ate my files, and support informed me that they were gone for good. So is this computer. I'm getting my PC back ASAP. This thing is garbage. Seriously; leave it where it is. Don't even THINK about buying one of these. It's the Etsel of computing.
