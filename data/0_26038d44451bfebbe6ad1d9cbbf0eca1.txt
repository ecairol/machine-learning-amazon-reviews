The computer is beautiful. The battery life is great. But I can say that Surfing the web in a Mac is way better. Trackpad needs to gets better.I only have 3 weeks with the Laptop and the Bluetooth and headphone jack just works whenever they feel like it.As far as today, if you want to spent that much for a laptop justto watch movies and not using an external speaker or headphone jack go a head as the display is astonish
