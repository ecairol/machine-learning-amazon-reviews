Horrible Product, even Worse customer Service
Pro:Its CheapCon:- Its CHEAP!- Crashes often- Very Sluggish and slow experience- You WILL change remote control batteries often, even if you will not use the keyboard (since its too slow to do any meaningful internet surfing).- Has a USB port but you cannot actually see your files. (lord knows what its for)- Remote control WILL STOP working, and customer service will try very hard not to help you.
