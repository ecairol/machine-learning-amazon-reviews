A surprise!
ive had this laptop for about a week now and i have to admit, im pleasently suprised of how much I like it. No its not the best laptop out there, but For me, it was worth every penny.Pros-Very easy to set up and get going.-Playing netflix and youtube is fast and i have no complaints in this section-The Laptop itself doesnt look cheap, very sturdy and slick looking.- Gaming, this is NOT a gaming machine, BUT that does not mean it can not play some older/ low requiring games. Games i have played ( Gmod, ran good on medium settings, Mount And Blade, really well, Total war Mediavel 2 demo, also ran very good on medium settings, and son to try out skyrim, just to see how well it will run. Minecraft will prob work fine on low-medium settings)Cons-Windows 8, now i had never used windows 8 before this, and i can say i really prefer Windows 7.- On start the laptop crashed/froze, but has not done it since.-It has some bad days of being slow, but i can look past that.OverallIf your looking for a decently cheap laptop to watch videos or do some light gaming , or to browse the web,then this is a very good choice for the price.I would recommend it.
