Great Value for the Right Users
It's not as bad as some of the reviews make out.  I'm a writer, and I've found nothing better to draft novels with.  I have a 1-hour commute to work every business day on a light rail train without Wi-Fi, and this Chromebook will let me clack away at my manuscript offline in Google Drive and then sync as soon as I get home and re-connect to Wi-Fi.  My internet connection is only about 3MB, but this device pulls up web pages just as fast as my Core i7 ethernet-connected PC.  Yes, the screen is nowhere near as good as an iPad's or $800 laptop, but it's fine if I'm not comparing this apple to those oranges and it's perfect for writing and lasting forever in terms of battery life.  You can really work or play all day on this thing.  The sound output from the speakers is decent, nothing to brag about but certainly not so bad that it distracts and dismays.  It's been a great value so far.
