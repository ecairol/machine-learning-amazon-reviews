Not so great.
Basic performance is OK, the Asus Chromebook has issues when many browser tabs are open; it gets noticeably slower.  That would have been manageable but the built quality is subpar:  the plastic case around the screen started to come apart after only a month of usage.  I returned this  Chromebook and bought the slightly more expensive Toshiba Chromebook 2 which feels more solid and has a better performance.
