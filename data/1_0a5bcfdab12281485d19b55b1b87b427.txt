Hardware is Good, OS Needs to Mature
I bought this strictly for wanting to be able to play with a chromebook, to see what it has to offer. Needless to say, I have been both impressed and left wanting more.On the hardware side, Asus has made a cheap, slick-looking case with an Apple like keyboard and touchpad that make the computing experience really enjoyable. The only thing wrong with the black model, is that your fingerprints leave smudges on it, they go away, but it is a little jarring at first. The hardware does what it needs to do in order for a sleek chromebook experience. It isn't going to be the fastest in scrolling, especially when a page is loading, but it boots up quick and has a very good battery life.Software side, I knew that the ChromeOS had its limitations, but I wanted to play with it and see what it's all about. If you've never tried google play services and just Google cloud services in general, this is a great start. It helped me realize the power of having all of your music, pictures, and documents in the cloud.I would suggest a chromebook if you have invested into the Google cloud, or if you are going to invest in it. It's worth it! Everything on your Android, PC, iPhone, iPad, tablet and chromebook will be accessible as long as you have your Google account and your files uploaded to the cloud. This just gives you immediate access to it and makes it obvious how to make the most of cloud computing. The biggest flaw is its greatest strength, it's a cloud first computer, it doesn't run many native applications. But they will eventually bring android apps and hopefully have a better selection of software in the future, and that's the reason it has four stars. Asus made a good product for this platform, it just needs to mature a little bit before it is ready for prime time.
