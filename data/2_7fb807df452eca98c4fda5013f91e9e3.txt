Great computer, bad touch pad (Maybe defect)
Great computer. Love every bit of it, except the touch pad is loud and not very good. Even just tapping it, it makes noise. As a solution, I put electrical tape along the bottom, which makes the mouse bottoms inoperable (Can still be used by touching and double touching, which is how I usually do it anyway.)
