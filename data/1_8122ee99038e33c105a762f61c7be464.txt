ASUS Zenbook UX305FA lightweight champ
Pros: light weight, excellent display in matte finish, quiet, did I mention that it's light?Cons: runs hot ... hot enough that I seriously considered returning the laptop since I would be using it while traveling and the heat is quite noticeable when it's actually on my LAP; even at full volume, sound is not very robust; no integrated LAN connection; windows 8.1 (need I say more?)Other Thoughts: Unit feels well-constructed and solid. The thing is a featherweight while providing a screen that's easy to work on with business applications. I really TRIED using Windows 8.1 but I just hated it. Classic shell has been my savior, and I will download Windows 10 (probably with Classic shell for that as well) for this unit. Wireless speeds seem fine, haven't noticed any serious lag in speed with the Core M processor (but doing mostly business work and light streaming with Netflix).
