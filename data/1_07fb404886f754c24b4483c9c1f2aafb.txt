This is a great laptop
I couldn't recommend this laptop more. At first I was hesitant about the Windows 8.1, but once you configure it and make it your own, it is a cinch to use . The speakers work well and the screen is great resolution. It doesn't have a fan! You wouldn't think this is a big deal, but all my old laptops had fans and they would get so loud and annoying. This laptop stays cool and quite. I've made a lot of mistakes in life, but this laptop is not one of them.
