GREAT LAPTOP REASONABLY PRICED!
Loving this laptop.  To my thinking it is a great buy for the price.  The processor is fast, the RAM is sufficient for what I need to do. It has 1 USB 3.0 and 2 USB 2.0 ports, an ethernet port, a vga port (why?) a decent webcam (not so great screen resolution tho),  a DVD reader/burner, an SD card slot, not so great sound quality (but what do you want for the price?) AND a free upgrade to Windows 10. For me, this is a great laptop and I am happy with it.  The two places where it could be improved is 1: the SD card slot, the card sticks way out and 2: the touchpad - I am unable to scroll using the touchpad and Toshiba's sometimes-helpful-support did not help me, nor did downloading the the latest touchpad drivers.  That aside, I am still happy with the device and would highly recommend it to anyone who needs a decent laptop at a good price.  UPDATE:  After my non-helpful support from Toshiba I finally discovered what you would think their tech people should know: the way to scroll using the Satellite touchpad is very simple; place tips of two fingers about 1/2 inch apart IN THE CENTER of the touchpad - as tho you were about to "pinch and zoom", and just slowly move your fingers either up or down and that will enable scrolling on the touchpad.
