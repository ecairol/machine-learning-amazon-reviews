You CAN record in 60FPS with OBS
It's amazing for the price, Sure I didn't buy it off of Amazon, But I would like to give some great tips for this webcam. If you want the best recording quality, you will want a better microphone unless you somehow get it working good because I notice the (stereo) microphones tend to carry out. You might want to use an external microphone BUT they are good for a conference room because of the Surround Microphones, but for just regular vids just use your PCs microphone or external one like headset. Want to record in 60FPS? Get a program called Open Broadcast Software (OBS) You will want to add Video Capture and add your Logitech Webcam C920. Go To Custom Resolution and make the resolution 1280x720 (720P) and make the FPS 60. You will notice a difference between stock 720 and 60fps 720. For the price of this webcam, it was better than my 200$ Camera. Logitech REALLY outdid themselves with this one. But one thing you probably should buy a USB extender and a tripod. It just makes the experience a bit better!
