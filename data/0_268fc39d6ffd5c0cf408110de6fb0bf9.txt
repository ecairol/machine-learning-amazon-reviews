Don't waste your money on this.
Worst laptop ever. Bought it for my mother and as soon as i started setting it up i was getting the "dinosaur" error message. Bad sign on first start up... The error messages only got worse to the point that I picked it up from my mother and am shipping it back tomorrow. I will never by a Chrome book again.
