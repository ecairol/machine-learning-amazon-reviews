Good cheap laptop
Bought this computer for my mom as she is going through college and needed a good, cheap computer. I gave her two options; this, and the HP Stream 13. She chose this over the HP Stream because she wanted a simplistic OS. I tested it and gave it my seal of approval, for the money. It's a $200 laptop, you get what you pay for. If you're willing to delve into Chrome OS then go for it.One thing that's weird about the laptop is the fact that when it's on, it has this weird light coming through the back shell. See photos for what I'm talking about. Don't know if this is supposed to happen, or maybe I just have a defunct product.
