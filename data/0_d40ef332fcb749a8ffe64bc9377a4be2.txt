Crashed Within 1 Month
I have not been really excited about this product. First, of all, the description said that there was a DVD drive. When I got the laptop, it would not play DVDs. Also, after only 1 month, I just had to send it to the company because it basically crashed. I am NOT a happy camper right now.
