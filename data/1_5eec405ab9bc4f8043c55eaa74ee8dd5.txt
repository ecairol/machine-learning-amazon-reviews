The Asus model is an excellent design and decent hardware
I already own a Chromebook so I am very familiar with the concept and build. The Asus model is an excellent design and decent hardware. I found that it lagged a lot more than I wanted it to, even with typing, so I returned it and am going to pick up the 4gb model.
