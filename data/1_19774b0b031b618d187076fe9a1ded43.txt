It's gimmicky.
I bought this 7 months ago and this device has steadily degraded over time.-1 Star for build quality. If you've ever owned a laptop before that didn't have a keyboard protector, you noticed eventually that your keyboard would start to get an ugly sheen due, which you couldn't clean off. This could be attributed to your oils accumulating, plastic layers being removed, or something else entirely I'm not sure. Now imagine that with this device's keyboard experiences that as well as the entire case. In essence, your device quickly looks unkempt. Sure, it looks great brand new, but you only get that look for a week.-1 Star for performance. With this device, you expect to get the best of both worlds: tablet and pc. What you get is a fancy laptop with abysmal performance. You're rarely going to use the tablet mode because it's inconvenient and the other two modes are a waste of time. Since this is a laptop, you generally are going to run your desktop essentials such as a firewall and an antivirus as well as some form of cloud syncing device to store your data. All in all, it takes about 3 minutes to start up where the computer is fully operational without lags and delays. But wait, loading your computer up from sleep wrecks havoc on your web browser (I use Firefox) if you left it open when you closed the lid.I suggest investing in a full laptop without the gimmicky touchscreen or a nice quality tablet. Either of this options will give you much better performance. Of course you could always shell out more money to get their premium tier products, but at that point you might as well get a surface.
