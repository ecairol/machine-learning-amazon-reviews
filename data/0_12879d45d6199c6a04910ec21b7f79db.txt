The worst customer service on the planet
I ordered this product from Amazon.  A $50 rebate was offered by ASUS.  After completing all of the paperwork including cutting up the box for the UPC code, signing a blood oath on their rebate form and submitting the Amazon invoice, ASUS rejected my claim because they stated that Amazon's invoice was invalid.  I told these fools that I submitted the only invoice that Amazon provided to me and they still rejected it.  I wish I had checked the Better Business Bureau in Fremont, CA for their customer complaint record.  It is astounding that they could have so many customer complaints and still remain in business.  Be careful before you order any ASUS product.  I would say stay away and find another manufacturer.  The computer itself is slow and loaded with Microsoft crap that slows the computer down considerably.  I wish I had not purchased this product.
