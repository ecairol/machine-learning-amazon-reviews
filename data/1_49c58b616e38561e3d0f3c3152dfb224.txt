Why did I wait so long
Bought this specifically to download and use some speech therapy applications for my wife who had a stroke.  The delivery was timely.  The applications are loaded and have been very useful.  All the other things we can do are a bonus.  We use the games after therapy in the morning.  And we can even check our e-mail.  We are getting along in age and were hesitant to spend the money on something so modern, but it really is not that difficult to use after a few days.
