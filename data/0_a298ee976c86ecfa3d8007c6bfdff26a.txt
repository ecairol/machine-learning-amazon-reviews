2 1/2 months later & it won't turn on or charge!
Bought this machine about 2 1/2 months ago, it's been working great until recently when it wouldn't turn on & stopped charging.  Amazon will not let me replace it because it is past the 30 days allowed. I take very good care of my electronics and I can assure you that the problem has nothing to do with misuse. I took it to a computer repair shop & had the power cord tested to make sure that wasn't the issue and was told that the power cord was good.  The guy at the computer repair store said it would cost more for them to fix it then to replace it so I guess now I'm stuck with a $200 piece of junk. He said he thought that maybe it was a "power jack pin" issue???  If anyone else has had this problem and has any suggestions on how to get this fixed, please let me know, I would love to have this machine up and running again.
