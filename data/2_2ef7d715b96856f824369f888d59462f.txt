Love so many things about this laptop except...what I knew I'd miss - the light-up keyboard AND it gets very hot sometimes while working on it.  One other thing - which I read about in reviews is that the video goes out and has to reset randomly.  It only takes seconds to reboot the video, but it's still annoying.  LOVE the size, weight, keyboard.  And once I figured out how to put files on the D:drive, I have plenty of storage.
