Can't start up on the first week.
I bought this laptop for one week and got lots of problem with this machine. The convert from headset and speaker is pretty slow. The back of the laptop is uneven. Therefore it is a little slippery. And today I can't even start up my laptop. I only brought it for one week! I know it is a great computer with reasonable price. But it should be a functional computer at first!
