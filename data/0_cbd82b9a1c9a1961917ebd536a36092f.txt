very very disappointing
a serious disappointment. I researched carefully before buying but returned this computer the day it arrived. Sound from speakers so atrocious, only explanation is that they were damaged. felt heavy and looked cheap. absolutely loaded with pointless and annoying apps that I didn't want. it felt like a cheap computer, but at $700, is vastly overpriced. simply cannot compare to the mac (much as I hate to admit it, since my mac barely lasted two years). asus has some serious work to do if they want to compete with mac in this market.
