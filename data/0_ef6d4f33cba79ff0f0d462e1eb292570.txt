Worse purchase I've made on Amazon
Wifi adaptor doesn't work- so no internetSpeakers make a lousy noiseKeyboard stops workingAll this after just 1 month and a half of purchasing, so only after 15 days the period for exchange and return ended (coincidence?)Lousy customer service too - don't buy from Happy Ranger
