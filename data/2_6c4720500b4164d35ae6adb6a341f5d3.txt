Fix Chromecast and it gets 5 stars!
Fast and simple to use.  Great price!  Easty to transport.  1TB of Google cloud storage is very useful.  Only issue is Chromecast.  There are very few choices so far, and I have had very sputtery luck with it even though my wireless signal is very strong and I keep the computer within about 10 feet of the Chromecast device on the tv.
