sound issue
Just got this from abt for couple days.Overall it's a good chromebook, light, fast and long battery life. But the reason i gave it 3 stars is because of its sound issue:1. the sound volume is lower than most of the laptop i used before. Usually 30% sound volume is enough for me on my previous laptops. But for this one, i have to turn the sound to at least 80%. Otherwise, i almost can't hear anything.2. Sometimes I listen to online musics and browse other website at the same time. But I found every time when I try to open a new website tab, my online music will lag a bit with some weird noise. Thats really annoying.Edit: issue 2 is quite weird, looks like it's due to that specific streaming service, since youtube works perfect. But when I did the same thing on my laptop, there is no lag. So I'm a bit confused. Anyway, since I cannot 100% sure its the chromebook issue, I changed this review to 4 stars.
