Not disappointed
I bought this because I wanted to download epubs from the jw.org website and it works great for that.  The publications download easily, after you download the free ibooks app.  Once downloaded, the publications have all the scripture links embedded, pictures, etc.  This makes jumping from publication to Bible unnecessary at meetings because the scripture references are all right there in the publication.  The books are located in your library as books, too. The iPad Air is easy to set up, easy to use, lightweight and the battery lasts a long time.I have two older Kindle Fires and downloading non-Kindle books was a pain.  I had to get help from my geek speaking son to convert the files, the scripture links weren't always there, they didn't appear as books, but as downloads without a cover picture, and the pictures inside were messed up.  I love the Kindle for reading Kindle books and watching movies, but the iPad Air is better for downloading and reading non-Kindle books.
