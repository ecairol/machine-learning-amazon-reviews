Battery Died Prematurely, Replacing a Nightmare.
Battery died 6 months after purchase and, surprise, the battery is not easily removed/replaced, you must take the case apart (9 screws of various sizes), and open case gingerly so you don't rip the power supplies going to hard drive, keyboard, and screen. In other words, you'll probably have to pay a tech to do it for you.
