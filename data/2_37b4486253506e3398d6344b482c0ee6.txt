IT pro says Fantastic!
I'm a software engineer and very picky with speed, quality, and display.  This chromebook has it all.  I wasn't sure about the processor, but it's plenty fast for most things, at the very least WELL worth the display.  I could have chosen the haswell c720 i3.. for a fast processor, but really.. the screen, build, keyboard, and overall experience is unparalleled.  I installed crouton xfce linux as well, which runs superbly fast.  My Desktop has an overclocked cpu with sata3 ssd, so i'm used to the super fast load times.  The only lag i've found is on facebook feed (not a big deal since i use tablet or phone mostly for facebook) and some 1080p youtube vids (again no issue since 99.99% of youtube vids are non hd).  I use 3 x 32 inch IPS monitors on my desktop setup and this monitor is right up there as far as quality.  If you're on the fence about which chromebook to get, take it from me, this is bar none the best value.  If toshiba made this exact laptop with a haswell core i3, it would be game over for all it's competitors.  (pixel isn't exactly in the same price range to be considered a competitor).  Anywho, enjoy!
