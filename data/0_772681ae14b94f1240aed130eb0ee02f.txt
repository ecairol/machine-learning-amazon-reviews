Not better than our Roku.
We have a first-generation Roku, a Netflix subscription and an antenna for local reception. We don't have satellite or cable. We supplement this with watching shows on Hulu (not Hulu Plus) and Sidereel.com.That being said, here are our impressions of the Hisense Pulse. First off it's very slow. By that I mean i you try and load a web page with a video player you are going to wait a while.Secondly it cannot go to Hulu.com. If you try it will take you to Hulu Plus but I don't have a Hulu Plus account. This must be a restriction of Hulu but it is also a major reason in my disapointmernt with the Pulse.Thirdly there are some websites that want a newer version of Flash installed in the Chrome web browser that it uses. I checked for updates on the Pulse but it said it was up to date. On a PC Chrome will automatically update itself and Flash but that doesn't seem to work the same way on the Pulse.Finally there are problems with the apps. SnagFilm just doesn't work and it was a pre-installed app. I went to the Google PlayStore and tried downloading more apps but the ones I wanted weren't supported on the Pulse.In summary the Pulse is no better than the Roku player I had. Amazon is a great vendor so I will be requesting to return the Pulse and go back to my Roku. It's faster and for my use it seems to have the same limitations. Google TV will probably rock one day but it's not ready for prime-time yet.
