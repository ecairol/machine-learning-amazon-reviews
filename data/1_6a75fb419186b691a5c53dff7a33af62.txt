A minor victory in the New Netbook War
Looks like the Chromebook's estranged brother is here. And he comes in two sizes. The Acer Aspire One Cloudbooks 11 and 14 are huge additions to the new netbook movement.To put it in so few words, these laptops are basically Chromebooks with Windows. And every aspect is a reflection of the price. The ergonomics is modest and the material is plastic. No weird avant-garde shininess. Screen is matte and, again, reflective of the price. One thing that I want to point out. Very very important. The keyboard is very sturdy, closer to a MacBook than a low end Asus. Although, this is more true for the 14 not the 11. Minimal flex and great key travel. It doesn't completely reflect the price; it feels like a keyboard from a $500-600 laptop. Great job Acer.Now to the more important part: hardware/software. Mmmmmm. It screams bare essentials. But you know, the price. Windows 10 runs surprisingly well as most other reviewers have mentioned. Minimum requirements for Windows 10 are lower than any previous version of Windows. Best advice I can give to speed it up is to research how to optimize Windows for performance. After uninstalling the programs and features you don't need, it should be a little quicker. 1080p playback is great offline, online is use up the CPU but it's more of a browser problem than anything else. Standard HDMI, USB 3.0 and SD slot all help sweeten the deal.BEFORE BUYINGIf you've decided on purchasing, which I hope you actually have, there are some things you need to know. For the 14, 12-hour battery life is 90% true for light usage. A cheap 64-128GB USB 3.0 stick wouldn't hurt. Neither will a neoprene sleeve.If you're like me and the majority of your laptop time is browsing writing (word docx.) and Netflix/YouTube, then you've come to the right place. Rejoice my people!
