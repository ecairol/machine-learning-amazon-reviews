Do NOT recommend
I purchased this TV in May and enjoyed the smart features for a few months.  Now that I have had it for about 3 months, it freezes constantly! The remote control becomes obsolete and most of the time I end up unplugging it. I managed to hook up my AppleTV to be able to watch shows but this TV still finds a way to disappoint - see photos with "No Signal" in the middle of the screen or the input information at the top.  Don't buy!!!
