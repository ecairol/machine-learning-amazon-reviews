Worked for exactly 3 days, until it wouldn't turn on
I bought it for my son for Christmas.  He used it 3 days and then it wouldn't turn on.  It must have lost it's charge, and then battery wouldn't recharge.  I dunno, as I returned it to Best Buy.  I think it's an interesting idea, but I am glad ours failed so early, so we could return it.  Reading the reviews, it's terribly unreliable...
