Fantastic computer, horrible OS
5 stars for the computer.  Light, very fast, and silent operation.  Battery life is phenomenal.  10 - 12 hours depending on how you use it.  Wish the SSD was a bit larger but an external is always available.  No stars for Windows 10. It is an abomination.  Constant interference from the os to "help" you with various tasks.  You can give up your life and data to Microsoft for the convenience of having everything in one place.  Wow, one less button to push.  The real annoyance is in the details.  Go try to drag something from your screen to the desktop.  Isn't gonna happen.  Go try to highlight a portion of a page and print it.  Ain't gonna happen.  Go try to 2 or 3 pages of an email.  No again.  But you can tell it to print the page you are on instead of all of them.  What a fantastic improvement over windows 7.  Can you hear my sarcasm?  I can go on but the good news is that IE 10 or 11 is imbedded in the os and you can switch to it which will allow the drag and drop features.  And if you have a prior windows password, say for Hotmail, you will end up using it to boot up (like I did) if you are not careful in you choices when booting for the first time.
