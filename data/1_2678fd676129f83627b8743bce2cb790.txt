Excellent small laptop
Very easy and quick to set up. The battery really last for a long time. I can't believe this laptop can be use for 3 days after one time fully charge. I usually use it for 3 to 4 hours everyday. For my old Dell laptop needs to be charge everyday, so that's why I love this little laptop so mcuh! It has an really excellent display and the resolution is good for this small screen. I also love the 2 in 1 option and the color is nice. Have to say at this price it is an excellent laptop!
