Quality is good but set-up has some issues
It was purchased for my FIL along with an optional mouse because he is older and touch devices are not very compatible with the motions of an elderly person.  The mouse and cursor work well with the Windows 8.1 that comes installed.  The unit comes with a lot of needless App icons and that needed to be cleaned up.  The biggest con of the purchase is getting rid of the "malware" that takes over your screen when in the middle of using an App.  It's very annoying!  You have to search the settings to find out where they are resident and eliminate them.  After about 8 hrs., I finally have it cleaned up and settings re-done to make it ready for my FIL to use with a fair bit of confidence.  I want him to have a good experience with the technology.  How does an inexperienced person get through the set-up?
