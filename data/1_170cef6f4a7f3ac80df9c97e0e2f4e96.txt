Pretty sure everyone know the good things
Fast shipping and delivery.Pretty sure everyone know the good things, here are the bad/average things.The key board is average.Speaker is actually not bad, but it is not great either.Touch pad have a loud click sound.No keyboard backlight.USB port is a little stiff, have to use some force to plug my usb in, but this will probably smooth out later.With SSD and fanless design, man this thing is smooth and quite. 750 bucks, amazing deal.SD card port is a little loose.
