Great Laptop - The specs of an Ultrabook at ta fantastic price!
I purchased this laptop a couple of weeks ago and love it.  It came preloaded with Windows 10 - a huge upgrade from the clunkiness of Windows 8.1.  The system runs great.  It's fast, makes multitasking easy, and quickly runs various applications without any delay whatsoever.  The one issue I have had and I have heard this is due to a need to upgrade firmware for W10, is the display driver dropping every now and again and then resetting.  It's happened only a few times and often when  the battery is low and the system is being overworked.  Otherwise, a great purchase.  Not sure what people are talking about when they refer to the issues with the mousepad and clicker - I don't have that problem and am glad I took the plunge to buy despite my reservations about the pad module.  Super light, fast, versatile, and packable.  Best bang for your buck for sure.
