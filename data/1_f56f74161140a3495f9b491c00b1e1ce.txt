A great little pc with a few downsides
I don't think this computer is getting the credit it deserves. It is a budget laptop, take it or leave it. For those who said it does not have a lot of power, they are right, it should not be your main computer. However, I am an architecture student who uses intense software like autocad and photoshop quite often and, while there were some noticeable lag in program performance, if you are doing simple tasks and take it slower then you should be fine. I bought this pc for a few reasons. 1: I wanted a laptop that was under $200 (or there abouts). 2: it has a USB 3.0 and a full SD card slot. 3: it had an advertised battery life of 12 hours (not joking I have gotten 16 hours of straight use out of it). 4: and was 3 lbs (ultrabook weight). I took a chance that it would be able to run the programs that I wanted (rhino, autocad, lightroom, etc) but it does (granted there is some slowdown with multiple programs open).I would recommend this pc as long as you understand ONE THING: you need to be okay that this is not the fastest pc out there and that you are paying for what you get, and what you get is a pc that performs admirably considering the specs it has.One last tip, if you do get this pc the first thing I would do is uninstall McAfee and install AVG free. The reason is McAfee uses an insane amount of processing power to run.
