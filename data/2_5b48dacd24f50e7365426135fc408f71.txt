Not tooooo bad.
UPDATED 08/09/14:Let me start by saying I am a tech guy, love buying and trying new things. The reason I bought this was to see how something so cheap could be any good. I witnessed how terrible chrome $200 laptops are (if you are smart, you know what I mean). But this laptop is by far a great piece of technology for the price tag of $250-280, if you are on a budget I think you should try this out. I know a lot of you may think because this doesn't have a touchscreen you shouldn't get it because of Windows 8... But realize it is very useful even without a touchscreen. I have yet to use windows 8 on a touchscreen(Besides a phone) and I am still in love. So like I said before just give it a try.Pros:Windows 8.1Keyboard, spaced out to perfection IMONUMPAD includedPriceVery LightSleekCan watch Netflix, and Play some games.Games I can play smoothly(All on Low-Med Specs): Minecraft, CS:GO, LOL, and GTA:SA. DOTA 2 dies not work on this laptop, I haven't tried WOW yet either.Cons:Touchpad, IMO they could have done better but hey for the price its fine, get another mouse if you wantDifficulty to take out parts/Upgrade partsI wish the battery life was a tad bit better. But who doesn't bring their charger ?Overall: 8/10
