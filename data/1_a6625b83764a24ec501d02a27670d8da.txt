One Good; One Bad
I purchased one of these for myself and am greatly pleased. I liked it so much that I ordered a second one for my wife.  Unfortunately, this second one was a lemon.  After initial setup, the Chromebook returned my wife to the logon screen after entering the password after each log on attempt.  I performed a powerwash after successfully logging in with my Google account,  I then did another setup using my wife's Google ID and had the same result - return to log on screen after each log on attempt.Since I was able to log in with my Google account, this led me to believe that there may be something wrong with my my wife's Google account (although she has no problem accessing Google services on her Windows laptop and smartphone).  I called Google customer service (who were great, by the way). They walked me through the creation of a recovery thumb drive in an attempt to rebuild the CHrome OS on the box, but the Chromebook would not boot from the recovery thumb drive as it should have.  At this point, Google customer service suggested that I return the Chromebook to the seller, which I have done for full refund.I still enjoy my Chromebook, but am hesitant to buy this same model from this seller for my wife again.  I found the device available for a lower price on the ASUS web site and I may purchase directly from them.
