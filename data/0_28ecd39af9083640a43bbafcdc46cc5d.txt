I find it difficult to get used to
I've tried hard to learn how to use my pad, but still finding it hard to use.I suspect this could be me...but it "freezes" up and I do turn it off and start over but some times it does not work.I'm thinking of giving it to my son and getting a laptop.I like the pad and the ease of using the keyboard.The size is perfect and it is not too heavy
