Lenovo should have advertised this product better as I did not even know there was a first version of it. if I had would have bought that would have saved me the headache of buying other product that did not meet my expectations. This review is being type on the Yoga's nice normal keyboard and when I want a Table can just fold it to be that, with it nice software that disabled the keyboard, there is no worry that will end up typing accidentally with it.Table mode is awesome but having other modes can be good as well as it can be used to show pictures at a wedding as a stand and unless someone looks close they would think it is a picture frame.Love my Yoga, for it size, versatility and 500GB hard drive. Making the Yoga a real PC with the power to run games as the video card is able to handle it, 4GB ram is lots more that you get on tables and if you really think about it might even be able to upgrade it to an SSD if you so desire.Disclaimer: Upgrading is only recommended if you are a PC technician and are sure you will not damage you device.
