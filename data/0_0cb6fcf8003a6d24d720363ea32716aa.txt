Wrong Item Sent
I received a notebook and not a laptop. I ordered a touch screen computer but the one sent is not. Secondly, it has no provision for CD/DVD by its side though the picture in the manual shows it has. Unfortunately I am supposed to travel this Tuesday night to Africa because the computer is for my son who just gained admission into university. I need to hear from you tomorrow to know what to do.  Thanks.
