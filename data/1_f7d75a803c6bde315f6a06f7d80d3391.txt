The operating system (Windows 8) is difficult for me to move my cursor around without by accident somehow bringing up an app from I do not where, then I have to go up to left hand top corner of the screen to retrieve what I was doing.  Also the battery only has power for about 2 1/2 hours verses the claim by the manufacturer of 5 hours, other than that, for the price I paid ($266.00) I'll keep it.  I was in Ecuador for 13 days and it was the only way I could communicate with the USA..
