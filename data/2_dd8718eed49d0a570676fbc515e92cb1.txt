I am in love with the Yoga 2
So far, I am in love with this Lenovo Yoga 2 laptop.  A novice tablet navigator, I'm still learning, but the design and layout is intuitive and easy to use.  I have had no difficulty loading my own programs via flash drive.  I wanted the power of a laptop plus the fun of a tablet, and think I may have just purchased one of the best the industry has to offer at a very reasonable price.  Time will tell.
