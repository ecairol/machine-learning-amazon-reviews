lightweight and powerful, but questionable battery life.
The laptop is thin and lightweight indeed, and looks beautiful. The screen is nice and bright. The processor and RAM is sizable enough for doing actual work on it, not only browsing and watching movies.My teenager is the programmer for his high school team, he uses the laptop there, and he says his software works without a snag. It is great for schoolwork, too. The laptop did not come with office installed.The touchpad works great, and I love the gestures for scrolling and zooming in and out, this kind of compensates for no touch screen. The power button is conveniently located right next to backspace and delete, and it looks and feels like other buttons. so in case you mistype anything, there will be not so slim chance the wrong letter would be deleted immediately with all your work alongside it, if you had not bothered to save before hitting that delete button. Yes, the button was assigned "sleep" function right away so this would not happen, but why did they do that? There is also a separate sleep button. I would have preferred them using those for something else and having completely separate power button somewhere where it would not be hit on accident while typing fast.The battery life is concerning, though. It says right on the sticker attached to the top of the display 12 hours battery life. After fully charging it, and working for 15 minutes on the battery, it said over 5 hrs left. I so not know what they mean when they said 12 hours, it certainly does not look like that at all. So far my son had been lucky to find an outlet near where he works, but I am not sure it will always be the case.
