Great laptop
Great laptop, its very thin, very light, very quiet (fanless), and very fast boot up!I bought this primarily to watch videos, music, and web browsing but didn't want something heavy or bulky and this fit the bill nicely.I upgraded to Windows 10 without issues.I would recommend uninstalling any extra software that is included.SSD performs better if the drive isn't too full, and you'll reclaim a little space from the extra software, and it'll keeps the system cleaner.  You'll have to decide for yourself which you want and which you don't.There are a few things that are a nuisance (although doesn't take away from the 5* because I knew ahead of time before purchasing).The keyboard isn't back lit.The shell gets covered with finger prints and are very visible, so if have clammy hands, you're gonna see lots of finger and hand prints on the shell.The screen isn't touch, with Windows 8 and Windows 10, it is very touch screen friendly, this would have been nice to have, but not necessary.  I would imagine within 3 years I can see all laptops going touch with the way MS is headed, and would have nice to delay an upgrade.I haven't tested battery life yet, but for what I use it for, I don't think it'll be a big concern.
