Where you have been all my life?!?!
Where you have been all my life?!?! I just finally laid my 2011 macbook pro to rest and did not feel all warm and fuzzy about dropping a couple thou on a replacement. I wanted something fast, AFFORDABLE, slim, light, and with a good amount of RAM. Done! Leaving te MAC OSX gave me a bit of anxiety, but Windows 10 is actually great and I'm so happy I missed out on having to use the previous version cuz every time I used a pc with that I got real stabby real fast.
