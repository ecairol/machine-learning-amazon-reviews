Perfect for on the go performance <<college haha>>
It's a complete mac-air and macbook killer. at this price this beast destroys its competitors and then some. the screen isn't touchscreen which is kind of depressing but i mean its so cheap so what can you expect. 256gb was extremely surprising for this price range though, its one of the only few laptops that have such a massive ssd for this size and price. The Intel-M core is pretty weak in comparison to some laptops but it can easily handle everyday tasks and some minimal gaming on the side (i got like 100+fps on league of legends with everything on low settings, so fiddle around with it and you'll get the perfect mix for the 60hz IPS monitor, which is beautiful btw) but in the same sense, it can't run any complex games. Battery life probably isnt the 10 hours as advertised since windows drivers suck and the battery monitor is screwy like all laptops but I was able to play league for a decent 2 hours and then do some light music streaming and web surfing for another 2-3 hours (you will definitely hit that 10 hour mark if you mess around with the battery performance settings).In terms of the external build, it is beautiful and sleek. in exchange for such awesomeness you have a fingerprint magnet haha. overall im pretty happy with this purchase to do my basic work.**don't buy this if you're into hardcore gaming with programs needing dedicated gpus and multiple cpu cores :)
