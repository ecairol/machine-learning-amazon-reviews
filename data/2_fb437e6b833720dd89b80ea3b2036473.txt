Issues
Wonderful slim notebook. Product specs say 10+ battery life, not the case. The first charge did state the advertised but after unplugging computer says 4 hrs remaining at a 100% battery charge, Disappointing as that was the main reason for my purchase. Also, have had over ten mini re-boot stating "display driver stop but recovered". Very disappointed in that, would reconsider before purchasing.
