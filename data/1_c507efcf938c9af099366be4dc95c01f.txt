Light, Fast, Quiet, and Cool
Other than having to deal with Windows 8 (not ASUS' fault), I love this machine. Reminds me a lot of my MacBook Air I had to give up, except quieter (no fan). Screen size is plenty big enough to get work done, and serves up shows on Hulu just fine. I will say the speakers are not very loud and a little tinny, but I never expect anything from laptop speakers and use something else when I care about sound quality.
