input is iffy
This machine definitely offers a lot at the price. A lot of fingerprints!Pros:Lots of storage and memory (at price range).It is very fast though and great for what I need it.Can VMware a simple Linux desktop just fine.Cons:the touchpad being so big and iffy. Sometimes it gets confused when you've rested a finger on the clicker and the other is moving aroundthe right shift key's sensor isn't always activated. i tend to get my pinky on the very edge of it and that's almost never a good spot.it's said that wifi range isn't great, but it is still better than an iphone5's :)
