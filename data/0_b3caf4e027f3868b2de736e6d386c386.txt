would not recommend
I bought this laptop for simple use.Walking Dead video links from AMCTV.com lag badly.HD youtube videos also lag badly.Doesn't seem like a problem when watching high quality videos from harddrive.Very laggy when trying to remote connect to my work computer.Overall, it sucks. But, well, guess I can't complain when I bought a brand new and cheap laptop.
