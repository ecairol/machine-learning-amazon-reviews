Pleasant surprise
Coming from Apple products I didn't expect much out of this laptop.The build quality is almost on par with my old Macbook Air, only things I miss are the mag safe adapter, glass touchpad and backlit keyboard, although the keyboard on the asus is nicer to type on for my taste.Zero noise due to it's fanless design and runs much cooler than I expected. Processor has been pegged at 2ghz turbo mode since I booted it up due to updates, etc and it's still running cooler than the mac it replaced.Hat off to ASUS for a well sorted product.
