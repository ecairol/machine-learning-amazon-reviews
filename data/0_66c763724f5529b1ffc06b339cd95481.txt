this is by far the most disappointing purchase i have made.  this chromebook will not play youtube videos or any videos for that matter.you can't even wire direct feed to your tv because the mirco hdmi will not pass video files without memory hiccups.  i've had other brand of chromebooks that were plugin and play everything.
