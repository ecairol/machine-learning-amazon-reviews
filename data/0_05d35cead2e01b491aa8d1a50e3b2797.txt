BEWARE: Facebook and YouTube crash!
Nice hardware and it has a better screen than my previous chromebook which was a 2013 Samsung. HOWEVER. It is very underpowered! Facebook makes it crash, and good luck getting it to play a YouTube video. This dramatically reduces its usefulness!! I can answer emails, browse websites and create documents, but in my view it is not a fully functional chromebook. I would not buy it again.
