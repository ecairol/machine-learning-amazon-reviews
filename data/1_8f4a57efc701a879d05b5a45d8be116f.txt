Very happy with my purchase, though battery life could be better
What I love most about this laptop is the form factor. Extremely light and thin. Easy to pick up and go with. Very fast, can open multiple tabs on my browser, listen to videos, and read articles without any hiccups. I can open and close the laptop and it instantly resumes from where I left off. This is good for people who are looking to do everyday tasks on the go.  I would not recommend this laptop if you are looking to do work that requires heavy processing as the processor just isn't meant for that. It's also not much of an entertainment machine considering the average speakers and intel graphics card. One great thing about the UX305 is the keyboard, which feels great and is very comfortable to use. The touchpad is big and works well, although the buttons feel awkward to press (feels flimsy). And lastly, the battery is not bad, but not as great as I hoped.Having used it for the past few days, it feels like I'm getting between 4-5 hours. The power adapter is nice though, small with a long cord, that is easy to tuck into your laptop bag. Overall though, I still love this laptop!**One thing I forgot to mention: I noticed that the monitor has a tendency to sway back if you lift the laptop from the front. It seems like a minor design flaw to me. Doesn't bother me too much as it only happens in those kinds of circumstances.
