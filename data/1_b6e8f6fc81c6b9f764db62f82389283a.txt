Best tablet for normal people.
I've had several tablets... Sony Tablet S, nexus 7, ipad mini, and now the ipad air... This is definitely my favorite.  The screen is big enough to allow for relaxing reading, but it's thin and light enough to carry around without it being a chore. Battery life is amazing. I easily get 10 to 15 hours on a single charge with normal use. Build quality is superb. I have an apple ecosystem at home, so it fits perfectly. My Mac mini, iPhone,apple TV, all seamlessly communicate. This works so well, I've decided to no rush into buying a MacBook Air.
