Love this Chromebook!
I bought this Chromebook based on the reviews it got for the screen and it didn't disappoint. The screen is fantastic. Best I've seen on any Chromebook to date. The speakers/sound is better than the average laptop. Build quality is solid and it's a sharp looking device. Keyboard and trackpad is very good. It's a silent / fanless laptop that holds charge really well for around the stated time. Good speed and no lag when scrolling through large pdfs or long web pages. Performs great for me.Important note that will be a big negative for most people, but it can be resolved... When I first took it out of the box and turned it on and saw the incredibly small fonts and icon sizes due to the high resolution, I was thinking "oh no, what is this?!". It's so small it's really unusable as is, which was very disappointing for something I expected to be great out of the box. Others have noted this as well. I first tried increasing the browser zoom level between 110% and 125%, which you can do in the Chrome browser on any OS. It helped, but I still didn't like the way everything scaled. It just didn't look right and I started having some serious buyer's remorse. But then I changed the screen resolution down one level to 1536x864 (and browser zoom to the default 100%). Although that somewhat defeats the purpose of a high res screen, it made everything look "perfect". Everything was at the right scale and easily readable. The screen still looks brilliant. Text is crisp, photos and videos still pop. That simple setting change significantly improved my satisfaction and now I have the laptop I expected.If you make the change I noted above, this laptop is a winner. I've been using a Samsung Chromebook as my only laptop for 2 1/2 years and was sold on Chrome OS and cloud computing a long time ago. It's not the future. It's the present.
