So far awesome...
I have just received the Hisense Pulse and had no issues with the setup so far. The 4 star rating reflects only the fact that I have just started using it. I do have a relatively older TV (5 year old Sony Bravia) which was not recognized but that did not present any issues. I can watch TV and do PIP with no problem. Netflix did not work but only because of the outage, and cannot wait to use it. I've attached an external 2TB hard drive I had attached to my Asrock 330HT, and was recognized and scanned easily. So was my LG NAS. Installing and updating couple of apps from the store was also fine.I will report more if any difficulties arise and will adjust the rating.Update 1:just like another commenter here, I will be returning the unit to Amazon as it is refusing to power up anymore. tried to reset it but to no avail. I did experience two freezes where I had to reboot the unit. after watching a movie on Netflix, it became unresponsive once again and does not power up. I will ask for a replacement probably.update 2:I traced the problem to a faulty HDMI cable but will wait few more days before I am sure.
