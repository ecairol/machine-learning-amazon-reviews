Does Not Play well with Windows 10
I've had this laptop for a little under a month and it worked splendidly for about the first two weeks, when it started getting stuck at a black screen when trying to wake up from sleep or hibernate, forcing me to hard restart. Recently, the NVIDIA driver just seemed to disappear from the software, and neither the installed Geforce experience, nor the NVIDIA control panel could locate the driver or the device. No kind of manual or automatic install of any of the driver updates would accept, saying that they aren't "compatible with this form of Windows," and leaving it pretty stranded as far as gaming goes. When trying to roll back the computer to its recovery point, it stays stuck in various stages of the update/reboot process for hours. I'm not sure if this is a windows-related software issue, or an inherent hardware issue, but It it extremely inconvenient.
