Failed to live up to expectations.
I am a huge fan of Android, Chrome OS, and all things Google. I was excited for Google TV to bring the power of android to my television, but this product failed to live up to my expectations.The Good:The Pulse connects easily and was easy to get setup and running. It worked well with my Samsung TV and Motorola DVR. The last update finally allowed Amazon Prime video. (What took so long Amazon?) The remote works well with a very good feel. The buttons give a good feedback. When it works, it is great. Transitioning between live tv and Netflix or Amazon Prime with a single remote is tv watching nirvana. The PrimeTime tv guide makes finding shows easy and is the best tv guide I have used. Unfortunately PrimeTime is one the biggest culprits of crashes.The Bad:The device is plagued with under powered hardware. Google TV has come a long way, but it is still not ready for the prime time if it is paired with such weak hardware. There are more than occasional glitches and freezes. I have had extensive experience with electronics and android devices so I was able to handle them without issue. After a while though even I got frustrated, and I know that if I was frustrated, most others would have given up long ago. The touchpad on the remote works poorly at best and the remote goes through batteries like crazy. Buy rechargeable or start stocking up on AAA in bulk.Bottom line: Since picking up a Chromecast my Pulse has been sitting on the shelf disconnected. I would recommend others do the same, pass on the Pulse and pick up a Chromecast instead.
