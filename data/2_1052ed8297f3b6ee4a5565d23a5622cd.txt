I really like this unit
After 4 months of use, I really like this unit.  I would give it 5 stars, except for one act of stupidity - the keyboard letters are lower case. WTF? I am a fast hunt-and-peck typist, so I rely on seeing the keys. Even with reading glasses, in less than strong light it is difficult to see the letters clearly, so ZERO for ergonomics.  Strangely, on the top row of keys where the "function" keys are in a traditional keyboard, the icons are large and readable. Go Figure.
