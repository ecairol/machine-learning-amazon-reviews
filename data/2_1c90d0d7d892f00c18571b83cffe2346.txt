Nice for the price.
Ours is a 3 person, 2 laptop household.I wanted to purchase an additional laptop for our home school lessons.Lightweight, speedy, and worth every penny.I didn't realize before purchasing though, that there is no drive for cds/dvds.In the future, I won't take searching the product description for this feature.
