Perfect for internet
Perfect for internet, email, streaming, youtube.  Very fast. 3 things I don't like, you have to sign in with password every time you turn it on, and you must open a Google account to make the most of this laptop, printers are a pain to get working with cloud, just search the internet, tons of forum questions  "CAN'T GET MY PRINTER TO WORK WITH CLOUD".  It boots up crazy fast, more like a light switch,  'ON' & 'OFF'
