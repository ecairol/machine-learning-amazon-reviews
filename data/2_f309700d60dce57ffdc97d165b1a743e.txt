Great general purpouse and light work laptop. Even with LINUX
The only thing truly missing is a backlit keyboard, but having said that, this is the best general purpose laptop that money can buy (especially if you got the offer on the microsoft store, for 599$).Very speedy for general purpose use. I am a programmer and photo editor. Programming in Java and C is a breeze, thanks to the 8GB of RAM and the SSD. Photo editing is also very quick, with the only moments with some stutters are importing large quantities of RAW files into your lightroom library, and similar tasks.Construction is solid. Props to ASUS for making such a nicely built laptop/ultrabook (or whatever you want to call it) for such a bargain price. We're talking about macbook 2015 quality, but with 3 USB 3.0 ports, micro hdmi, sd card reader. Only con is a light backlight bleed, noticeable only on back or very dark backgrounds and high brightness settingsEven some light gaming can be done on the Core M processor. I played some CSS, CS:GO and Portal 1 & 2 without major hiccups. Not a gaming pc by any means, but if will allow you to pass some time on light games.The 1080p screen is great for size and pixel density, and i prefer it being matte and non touch, as those are extras not needed on a laptop. The non insane resolution on this particular model (FHD), is also a bonus for me, as it allows you to have a good compromise between screen real estate, and pixel density for text. MATTE is awesome.For the size, and for being extremely lightweight, it also has a very respectable 7+ hour battery life.UBUNTU and other linux distros work wonderfully on this pc, and linux is also my primary os for this computer.If you use a laptop as a laptop, buy it, you won't regret it. If you need desktop replacement power, look elsewhere.
