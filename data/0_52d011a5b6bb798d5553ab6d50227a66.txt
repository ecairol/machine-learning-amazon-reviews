The Dell XPS Laptop is the WORST computer I've ever had
The Dell XPS Laptop is the WORST computer I've ever had. Do not buy it -- it's a waste of money! Less than one year of owning it & it freezes at least 1x/every day. The BSOD of death also shows up. There answer was to send it in to their depost and to replace the hardware and reinstall the operating system. All of my files were lost and I had to purchase programs again. Everything from microsoft office to photoshop. Less than 2 weeks after having the laptop back & reinstalling everything it has started freezing again. Dell says that since they fixed it once they say the case is closed. Worst customer service. I used to be a faithful dell customer but now I'm gone.
