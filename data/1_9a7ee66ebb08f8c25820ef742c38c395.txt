Its a three star for me.
Cons- 1) Gets really hot when streaming 480p video on YouTube after 5 mins of streaming. Cant keep it on lap. 2) Track pad is not sensitive enough. Tough to fine control. No software to enhance the sensitivity of track pad. Does not support the bandwidth of att wireless modem. I needed to buy separate USB adapter to get wireless connectivity at home. It worked fine on other public networks though.
