Buyer Beware
I've had a Vizio 32 smart TV for about 18 months. At first it was great. Good streaming, clear pic. Usage is 1 to 2 hrs daily. 2 months ago the sound started getting weird...buzzing and crackling...I just turned up my external speakers louder and ignored it. Today the internet connection canceled out and I've spent a couple hours now trying to fix it but have had NO LUCK!  Online search provides a plethora of info how to reset/reconnect this TV..It  seems to be a rather common issue. I just want to warn prospective buyers.
