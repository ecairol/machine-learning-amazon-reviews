Awesome.  No issues, even with the refurbished version.
Yes, I was a little hesitant about ordering a refurbished product, but saving 20% ($100) was very tempting. I'm glad I did. It arrived fully sealed by Lenovo, was an official factory refub. In fact, it looked totally brand new!  Not even a fingerprint.  Now, about the laptop/tablet/Laplet aka Yoga convertible;  Awesome.  It's actually my wife's, but I'm her IT support, so I can tell you it's been all smooth sailing. She's a light duty user. Just WORD and the interwebs. I'll ask her to add more soon...UPDATE 2-16-2015  Still going great.
