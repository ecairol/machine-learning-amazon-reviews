Asus is a good brand and Company
Asus is a good brand and Company...I have an Asus gamer motherboard in my Desktop and is excelent!!! BUT... this computer is AWFUL. I just buyed it to work on internet and watch youtube and always freezes, and the worst is that weeks after i buyed it the computer it sent me some damages and repairing messages while it was initializing, then it tooks 3 days to fix (I dont know what) and then reset itself. Now is ok!, and the price of this pc is because it uses an old technology.
