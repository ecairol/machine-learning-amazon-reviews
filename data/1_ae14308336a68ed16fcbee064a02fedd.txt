Intel driver keeps crashing in some situations (ASUS UX305LA)
I've had this product for 3 weeks now, and I LOVE IT SO MUCH! However, the only issue I'm getting is that the Intel display driver keeps crashing regardless if I update it to the newest version, or downgrade it to the previous driver version. I've noticed that if I watch a movie with the AC connector plugged in, there's no driver crashes. However, when I watch a movie in full screen using the laptop battery that's not plugged in, I get frequent driver issues. This isn't too big of an issue for me as I mainly use this ultrabook for school related things (excel, word, reading PDFs etc.). I hope ASUS reaches out, as I did go on their website for this specific model to try to fix the driver problem with no luck so far.
