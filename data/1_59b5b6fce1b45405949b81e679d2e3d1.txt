Stay away from refurbished or warehouse specimens.
Bought a refurbished version-thought I was saving money. Turns out there was no charger included. (which was technically listed in font 8 on the very bottom). Had to purchase charger separately. Ended up paying more overall than if I had just bought the damn thing new. Lesson learned, I suppose, but still. Dirty pool. Will let y'all know how the computer is once the charger gets here next week.
