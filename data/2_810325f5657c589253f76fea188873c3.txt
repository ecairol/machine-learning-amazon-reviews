utility is good, boot time is top notch
As advertised.Compact, sleek, capable. Not for gamers or those running multiple resource intense programs at the same time.Two major areas of deficiencies are volume output and keyboard. Few of my keys are slanted after repeated use (F4 key)The volume output is minor issue for me as I purchased this as a mobile unit and I tend to carry headphones with me.Overall, utility is good, boot time is top notch, and half the price of Apple's air book. Worth the trade off.
