this is the perfect fit. My one complaint
I'm a huge fan of the Chromebook concept as a sleek internet box. I'm especially fond of the notion of using these as computers for people who don't know about computers, i.e., my mom. "Yes, mom, I can help you 'Google in to your Netflix." For someone whose entire use of a computer consists of email, Facebook, online shopping, and movies, this is the perfect fit.My one complaint, which is kind of gigantic considering the intended use, is that the hi-res screen leads to teeny-tiny UX elements. Yes, you can blow up the text in the web page, but you can't increase the size of the UI elements without lowering the resolution. Now I realize that Chrome OS can't be all things to all people (that's how you get crap like Windows), but old people are a huge potential market for these things, and they can't see the icons on the stinkin' screen. I know the elderly isn't the hippest market, but they're there for the taking with this product. This is a widely-known issue, and it seems relatively easy to fix compared to other capability gaps.
