Needs to be Brought to Current Versions of Android and Chrome
This item should no longer be sold as it has very old version of both Android and Google Chrome, neither of which can be updated to current.  My interest in this item was for its advertised Chrome web browser.  This version does not allow for logging into your Chrome account and having access to your favorites, etc.  Also, because the version of Android is so old, it has limited capabilities, and access to only a limited subset of applications at the Play Store.  It may work with the subscription services, but my TV and DVD player both have those capabilities, but lack web browsers.
