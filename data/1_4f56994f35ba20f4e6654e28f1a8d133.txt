Excellent laptop
So far I love it.  The unit is light and easier to carry.  The screen is very easy to see and the matte type finish keeps the glare down to where I can sit in front of the living room window with no problem.  I have just started using it and have had no issues at all, everything is working just fine so far.  I will definitely revise my review if any issues come to light but so far it is awesome.
