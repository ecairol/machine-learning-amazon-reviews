The perfect laptop for my needs
I got the Core M version with a $100 rebate from a different store because I didn't want to wait one day for shipping, but first discovered it here on Amazon.This laptop met all my needs and wants while excluding any unnecessary frills:1. Small and light2. Long battery life3. Strong performance (not for high end 3D gaming or other GPU-intensive tasks)4. Low-temperature and absolutely no hardware noise5. AffordableI don't need super-performance, a touch screen, a back-lit keyboard, great speakers, or a bunch of different ports (my big, heavy laptop has all that). This awesome laptop cuts back on these things in order to give us all the things on my list above.I can run Chrome with 20 open tabs, Visual Studio Enterprise 2015, Eclipse, Adobe Reader, Word 2016, and whatever else all at one time with no slow-down or heat. It gets a little warm, but it's never felt uncomfortably hot on my lap. The wifi is fine. I don't know exactly how long the battery actually lasts, but I can go more than a day with heavy usage without going below 30%. I haven't had any problems mentioned by other reviewers. Oh and it's really solidly built and beautiful. If I could I would marry this machine.If your needs are similar to mine and you still aren't sure, just get this.
