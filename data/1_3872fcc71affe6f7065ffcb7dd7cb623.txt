Supervised Users lose all apps except for Chrome - Seriously?
This could have been 5-stars, but for a HUGE software design flaw. The premise that makes this so great for kids (and why I chose the Chromebook over a windows-based laptop) is that you can be an account manager and set your child up as a "supervised user" so that you can view and control internet use. Only problem is, once you set up the supervised user account, all the apps disappear from that account. The only thing left is Chrome. What kid in today's world wants a computer with no apps? The only way to give them access to the apps is to set them up as a regular user. Kind if defeats the beauty of the original concept. So if you don't mind the risk of going to a whole new and untested operating system, that is still in the 'Beta" version, as far as I know, then it's ok, but personally, I took that risk exclusively for the "supervised user" function, which I now know I can't use without giving my child basically an empty box with Chrome in it. No apps. Why they did not see fit to allow the account manager to approve the apps they want their child have access to is beyond me! So all you Chromebook buyers out there, just be aware that if you are buying for the Supervised User" feature, you either have to disregard it, or set your child up with no apps whatsoever, just the ability to go online, which then, you can supervise.
