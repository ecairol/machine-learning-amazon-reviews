Absolutely thrilled until...
Product has great battery life, screen resolution was great, the 13 inch is perfect size and very light/portable, and it comes in great colors. My only complaint and why I'm returning it is because the operating software isn't what I needed/want from a computer. If it came with the windows operating system I would be keeping it and buying another but it's just not feasible to use the chrome operating system with what I need to do. If you don't mind not having access to windows software then it'll work for you, but if you absolutely need Microsoft Office, excel, ect. then it's not a good choice for you.
