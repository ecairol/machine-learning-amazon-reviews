"Best laptop I have bought"- Student
AMAZING! The computer is so light and thin, first off. Windows 10 is so much better than that awful Windows 8 so if you were worried about OS, don't be. Sound is incredible. Great battery life! Looks nice too so that's a plus. I've been using it lightly since I got it around 12 hours ago and my battery percentage is in the 80s! I recommend for students!WORTH IT! So worth it.
