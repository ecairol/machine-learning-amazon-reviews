chrome OS is disgusting!!!!
I dont know why people make a big deal out of chrome OS. it is absolutely useless!!!! you cant install any simple windows or IOS software/app such as Skype properly !!! Not even android apps work on it without jumping through some hoops (and even then they still do not work!). The apps that come with it are also useless ... I try to have a video call using google hangouts and the video quality was pathetic!!! This is not a foreign app!!! Made by Google to use on a google device!!! Either the camera gets stuck or software is glitchy. It constantly freezes... I have been reading these great reviews about chrome OS and I cant believe people actually use/like these disposable garbage machines  ... I bought it for my mother hoping that it would be easier for her to use but I cant let her use this garbage and get frustrated with apps not working on it properlt ... spend $50 more and buy a cheap 32 bit PC!!! It could be slow but it will get things done unlike this "garbagebook"
