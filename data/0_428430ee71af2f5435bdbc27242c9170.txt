I dubbed it as "craptop"
This has been the worst computer I've even owned so far.I got the machine 2 days ago and out of the box had to install drivers for the Wifi to work. I live in a 1 bedroom unit and as soon as I step in the room- wifi signal drops to about 2 bars and drop to 1 to none as soon as I set it on my desk. My previously owned Mac and my work laptop (Lenovo Think Pad) gets full bars in every corner of the house so I find the XPS' wifi status to be unacceptable.It would have been the perfect laptop but what is is a laptop if it has a very unstable wireless internet connection. It really amazes me how this computer got rated so high. I returned the product today after having to install and reinstall drivers and after a visit with Microsoft techs support center. I see no use trying to make it work. If I am going to shell out close to $1,000 on a computer, I want o enjoy it out of the box instead of scrambling to get it to work.Do yourself a favour and steer clear of this one.
