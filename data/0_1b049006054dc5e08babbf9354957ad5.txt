Don't waste your time unless you really know what you're buying but Buyer's beware.
Amazon should design a strong Firebook to compete with the lame Chromebooks. I received my ASUS Chrome book yesterday and liked the in boxing experience but that's where the enjoyment ended, I thought with the special Amazon was running even if I was disappointed with it, no worries.  However it's promoted to have WiFi-AC which it doesn't, states an update will happen to provide it-how do I know? Secondly the lack of available APPs is surprising low, I wrongly assumed all Android APPs would work. Then all the offers on the device where not available although I was well within the timeframe to redeem them, this leads me to believe ASUS shipped a refurb/open item. I was willing to contact ASUS Support to clear this items up as ASUS is one of my favorite brands however on day two the screen goes dead.  So I'm shipping this piece of junk back never to try out a Chrome book again and stick with full Android or Amazon products.  I did not have high expectations but was curious about a Chrome book so this is not me expecting a laptop and being disappointed.  Everything about it especially the OS was disappointing.
