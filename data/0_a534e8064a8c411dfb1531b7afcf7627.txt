*Only* What it Says On the Tin
For anyone else wanting just a Windows 8.1 laptop, it'd probably be fine. But if you try to install any other OS, buyer beware. Installing either Debian or Ubuntu based OSes (Mint and Peppermint in my case) means almost every single proprietary driver does not work. That makes sense, until I found that the brightness settings cannot be changed and the Wi-Fi is completely inoperable under a non-Windows system.If you're buying this device for casual use in Windows 8.1, it'll probably be fine, otherwise, steer clear. The driver set is a leaning tower waiting to fall.
