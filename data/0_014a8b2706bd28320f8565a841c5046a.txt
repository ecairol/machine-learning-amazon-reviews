Get a MacbookAir instead much better quality control.
This is not black its more like eggplant color, Looks just like a Macbook air but the screen is not the greatest. Unit I received had been opened before and was missing the ethernet dongle and the upper right portion of the screen bezel had a lump in it as if sand or grit had been trapped under it when they sealed it. What was mpst upsetting was all thsi had been stuffed back into the box and re-shrinked wrapped. Called Amazon on the phone and they were great and I am returning it for a refund.
