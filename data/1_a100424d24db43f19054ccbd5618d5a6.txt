A little handy almost laptop computer
A little handy laptop but not actually a laptop. I was very surprised by how quickly boot up and the battery performance.it lasted almost 8 hours and that was way more than enough for me. However, I was a bit disappointed by the resolution of the screen and the bezel of the screen is too wide so kinda doesn't look cool but nothing in hindering to do the job.Internet connection is good and strong also. I like it.
