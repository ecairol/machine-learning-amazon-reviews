Malfunction... return
I'm not sure if it was the firmware upgrade or that it failed out of the box, but this unit had an issue with shutting down properly and starting up after a shutdown. When I shut it down a red light would appear on the front of the box. If I tried turning it on at that point nothing would happen. The only solution was to unplug the power source and then it would turn on. The box it was shipped in was damaged, so maybe that had something to do with it. The return process was efficient.I am still waiting for a browser that allows free Hulu to play, or a device that can stream WTV files from a Windows Media Center PC over WIFI that is not a pricey Media Center Extender. Any thoughts?
