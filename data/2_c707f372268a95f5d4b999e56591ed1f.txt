So close to perfect
This is a great little machine and would have received 5 stars from me were it not for the weak hinge. After 3 weeks of use the hinge on my unit would no longer hold the screen up at any less than a ~60 degree angle...still useable, but I'd have exchanged it were I not already so dependent on this lightweight, capable little beauty. I really do love it, and I don't think there's another 13" ultrabook out there with these specs in this price range. Just be careful with the hinge or you'll have to remove the bottom of the case to clamp the metal hinges back down.The only other gripe I have is the location of the power button - I've hit it before and worrying about it while typing can be slightly distracting.With that said, I probably use this more than most people would a machine of this size - for several hours a day in several locations.Likes: Battery life, quality FHD *non*touch-screen (less battery drain and who uses metro anyway), 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, sturdy, flex-free chassis & kb, trackpad experience, silence and, most importantly, it retains usability while remaining sleek and quite light.Dislikes: hinge, power button location, have had some issues with Firefox freezing and closing that may be due to the new M series processor.
