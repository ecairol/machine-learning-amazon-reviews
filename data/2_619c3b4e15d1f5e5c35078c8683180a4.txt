Wonderful laptop, great price!
I am so entirely pleased with my purchase! Perfect laptop for a student.I bought mine refurbished and have only found one small scratch near the mouse pad but it is unnoticeable.The sound on the laptop is surprisingly good and the screen is clear and bright. I have had no issues since buying this laptop. I would most definitely recommend this laptop to anyone.
