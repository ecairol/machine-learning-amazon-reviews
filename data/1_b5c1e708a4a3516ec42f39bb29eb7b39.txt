Errors with the graphics driver - However they have now been resolved
I had graphics problems with the desktop I built using the new Skylake processor. The display driver would keep stopping when using web pages. I kept trying different things and finally found a PDF showing the recommended memory for my new motherboard. This resulted in my changing the memory chips and suddenly I no longer had any issues. Now I am having the same problem with my new Lenovo. It is not a total show stopper since I can do most anything else, but it really is annoying. I also can't use a plugable hub because the external monitor doesn't display properly. My old Dell from work is running Windows 10 and everything works fine. That rules out the other hardware and the software. I am seriously afraid they put lousy memory in this machine and I am not about to open it up and change it out.11/8/15 - The system has now grown stable. If even works with my plugable dock. I am not sure if it was windows 10 or driver updates that fixed the issues. I am just glad it working correctly now. I upped my rating from 1 to 4 stars. I can't give it 5 stars because I don't think Lenovo should have released the product until all the bugs were worked out.
