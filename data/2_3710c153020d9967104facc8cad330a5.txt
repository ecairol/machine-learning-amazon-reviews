Very happy, now
Ok, when I first received this product, the underside just showed model UX305F, and came with a USB/RJ45-ethernet adapter.  Panic mode!  However I went ahead and cabled-up the Ethernet-cable, checked the Device Manager to locate unidentified devices, and found an unidentified network adapter.  At the same time, I checked all the rest of the hardware specs to verify that this thing shipped to me really had all the correct cpu ID, cpu speed, memory size, SSD size, etc.  Everything checked except the absent wifi.  So, I visited ASUS website, accessed the support downloads for this device, and started updating everything.  After downloading the wifi driver, there it was, the correct wifi device.  After the drive installation, the wifi easily connected up with my home network, and performed up to speed.  (Whew!)  Next, I ran some video-editing benchmarks, just to make certain the 0.8GHz-2.0Ghz cpu performance was really there, and it was.  The video-clipping task executed within the expected 2.0 Ghz time.  Bottom-line, this model really is a very nice performer, particularly for the price.  One thing, if you are expecting a touch-screen, then you will be disappointed, but the touch-pad appears to support the latest Windows 8.x gestures just fine.I'm very pleased to this point, but I can see where somebody who is not as tech-savy could be pretty unhappy unless they quickly enlist some online support.
