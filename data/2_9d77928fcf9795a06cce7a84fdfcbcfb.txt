High res, easy to use, good sound
I think my video is self explanatory. Those are the results a complete amateur who has never used a web cam before can get within 2 minutes of plugging the cam in.It sits nicely on top of my computer monitor and is easy to adjust. It's good in low light. It's good in high noise environments. It captures detail. It auto focuses on your face. This is basically logitech's flagship cam as of 2012. I read a lot of reviews. I wasn't sure I wanted to shell out the cash but I wanted the best. And if the best is $100, I figured I didn't have much to loose. I also own a logitech gaming keyboard and gaming mouse and 3.1 speakers, all of which have lasted me 5+ years each. Their products are all built to last.I don't see how anyone could use one that doesn't auto-focus.
