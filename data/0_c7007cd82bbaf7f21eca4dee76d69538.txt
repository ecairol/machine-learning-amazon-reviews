Not Worth the Money
Let's face it, Apple produces highly polished products with a rich app ecosystem.  Many apps are optimized with animation and are even better on a larger screen, but....This device is not worth $500, its not worth $400, it probably should retail between $300 and 350, and here's why:*Locked in system. You have very little customization options. Yes, you can change wallpaper and move icons around the homescreen, but that's about it. No making the device an extension of your personality like Android.*Speakers. For being the most popular gadget on earth, why are there not stereo speakers on this device (one on each end of the tablet)? This is a serious design flaw that makes watching videos a huge drag because sound is muffled especially if the device is leaning on your lap.*Multitasking is a joke. These devices can only perform one task at a time. Apples competitors such as Samsung and Microsoft have already addressed this in their tablets, why hasn't Apple?*Screen Casting. This is not equipped with Miracast or have an HDMI out port. This means if you want to show your devices screen on a TV, you can't without buying a bunch of overpriced adaptors and cords.*Maps. Everybody knows that Apples map product is inaccurate and not worth installing.*No official keyboard, no official stylus, no ports, no casting, no multitasking, poor audio... why is this $500 again?
