Text wont get bigger, brightness control minimal, very slow to set up
I tried making the text larger and it was not possible. In the default resolution , there was option ro make smaller but not larger- the slider wasalready by default on largest size. . I then changed the screen resolution from the default all the way down to about 1400 by 768. That inceased the size of the icons but not the size of the text! Finally i tried using the magnifier. That made everything jump around and i couldnt find anything. I also tried changing brightness to make it dimmer. The control is minimal only allowing minimal dimming- thats odd since with led backlighting it should be so easy to allow more dimming. (But it was not overly bright , unlike other laptops) Since i cant read the text i cant use the computer. Note It also took forever to set up- never had one that slow before plus the plastic computer really reeks of new plastic - guess that would fade with time. This seems like a computer for kids to me,,
