So far not too good
I got this pc on December 2014, it's Benn almost a year. It came well packed and in good condition. I never take it outside my house. Only use it to watch Netflix, surf the internet and listen to music, no gaming or heavy usage at all. Never overcharge it, BUT the battery just stopped working, it won't get charged anymore just because. And to make it even better, it's not removable!!! Like yayy, great! So now I can't just go and replace it. I don't know what to do. If you don't want problems with changing the battery after it stops working for no reason, don't buy thin laptop.
