Superb
This is my second iPad, I purchased an iPad 4 around a year ago.This iPad air is all I thought it would be and much more; it's muchthinner and the 64-bit A7 processor makes it faster it is also quite narrower although the screen sizeremains the same 9.7 inches.The retina display is  stunning and the battery life is great. You just can't beat Apple for quality.The first thing I noticed when picking it up is the difference in weight, this iPad air feels almost halfthe weight of my iPad 4. I can easily hold it in my hands for long periods.Like one reviewer alluded to earlier..... and judging from the comments of some, it seems thatthe major gripe most folks have about the iPad  Air is the price.I am almost sure if the price of the iPad was dropped close to that of those lower quality and lower pricedSamsung or Google Nexus; these same folks would be singing the iPad's praises.I have hesitation in recommending this product.
