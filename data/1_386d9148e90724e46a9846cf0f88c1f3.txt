Not the computer for me
The computer was smaller than I had anticipated, that was my first disappointment. After playing around with it for a few hours I decided there wasn't much difference between this computer and my iPad. I have heard really great things from people who own the larger size of this computer, and it is probably a fine computer. In the end I decided it wasn't worth the money since I already had an iPad.
