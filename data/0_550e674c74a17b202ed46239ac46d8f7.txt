Terrible product...Why is this getting rated so highly?
I bought my XPS direct from Dell.  I got the tough display, with dual core i7, 256GB SSD and 8 GB RAM.  Here are the Pros: Looks good and feels sturdy.  Aluminum and Carbon Fiber design is top notch.  First Dell laptop that I have owned that did not overheat...Score 1 for Dell.  Doesn't get the battery life they claim of 9 hours, but I get a goo solid 4.  Considering Dell battery life on their other laptops outright suck, at least Dell is getting closer to the numbers they advertise.  Decent port selection, but good have included a full HDMI.  No worries an adapter fixes that issue.  Screen is smaller than what I am used too, but nice.  I don't give a hoot about the 3200+ display.  Who actually uses that?  I got the touch display.  I love touch displays on Lenovo.  I have found them useless on Dell, unless you chop the physical keyboard off.  Why have an onscreen keyboard?  Again Useless feature that you pay a lot more for.Now for the cons:  This is a very slow laptop.  My 2013 Lenovo with Haswell's i7 dual core kicks the XPS 13 butt.  I am having network problems.  drops network and is very slow on my network.  For instance it takes a long time to download webpages with images...So the Microsoft store is slow...It can't handle multiple jobs at once.  The speakers suck.  They are either too loud or too quiet.  No in between and they sound horrible.  The mic is useless unless you want people to see your hand or up your nose.  The Mic in my laptop doesn't work and Dell will not do anything about it.And then there is the issue of Dell.  They have the absolute worst tech support and customer care.  The manager actually offered my $50 in grievances for having to deal with their own tech support.  They have done nothing to help me and they honestly don't care.  I have spent the equivalent of 5 days with them on the phone over the course of a few months on issues with this computer and others.*************This is an update to my review above**********************I updated all drivers and windows updates that I could find updates for and performance has actually declined.  Cannot stream music from youtube without the audio cutting in and out.  Cannot stream video.  Tried downloading a game from the microsoft store called Talisman.  Runs the game, but very choppy.  It is having trouble with the graphics.  The screen blinks in and out.Overall, I am so disappointed with Dell.  I have purchased the XPS 13 and XPS 15 in the past 2 months and both have been riddled with hardware and software problems.  My Lenovo Thinkpad (2013 version NOT 2014) was the only computer that I have owned in the past 12 months that actually provided me with the performance and reliability that I wanted...Read reviews on the XPS 12, 13 and 15.  After about 30 to 60 days the laptops seems to become riddled with issues that Dell doesn't seem to do anything about...Be careful when buying from Dell and be sure that you know what you expect and how to fix things if they break.  Its all on you.
