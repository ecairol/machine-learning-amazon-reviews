ASUS Notebook Holds its Own
For a small device stripped of unnecessary fineries, the ASUS notebook does the job; it comes with windows 8 which was new to me but if you're a Windows/PC USER you will quickly catch on. The help function, F1, is also robust in this regard. It would be nice if it were also touchscreen; and the keypad mouse isn't ideal, but that can be remedied by plugging in a mouse to one of the USB ports. Amazingly, the notebook comes with HDMI AND VGA graphic interface plugs. It does not, however, come with a DVD/CD drive. For the price I'm rating this lightweight, functional and highly portable device 4 stars.
