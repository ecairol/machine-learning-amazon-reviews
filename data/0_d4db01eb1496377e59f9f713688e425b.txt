Buyer beware.  Probably better off getting something else.
Just received my second Zenbook.  Had to send the other one back because of screen damage.  This one I just received looks like it was sent back, re-wrapped and shipped out again.  I don't see any damage to the laptop, but the inside of the box it came in looked like garbage like someone had shoved it back.  I'm thinking because of the LCD screen bleeding around the edges (which I've heard others discuss and which is also obvious with this laptop).  Anyway, that part doesn't bother me that bad.  I like the look and feel of this product.  However, when running windows 8.1 I notice that I have McAfee running in the taskbar.  It's wanting me to purchase and install the full product.  DAMMIT, it's already installed and running as a service.  I don't want this crap.  I want to uninstall it.  So...let's go to "Programs and Features" and remove this bad boy.  Oh boy!  It's not listed!  How the hell do I uninstall this?  Thanks for being complete s***s, guys!  Now I have to figure out how to forcefully remove this garbage bloatware from my brand new PC.  Very disappointing up until this point.  I thought that I loved ASUS.  I have two monitors that are ASUS.  Both work great!  I have a Google Nexus 7 2013 made by ASUS.  Works great.  Thought this would be a good deal.  I was wrong.  Better off just buying a cheap HP.  Good luck.  Buyer beware.Also, the resolution is crap.
