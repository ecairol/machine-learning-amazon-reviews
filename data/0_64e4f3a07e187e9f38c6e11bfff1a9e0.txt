Edited review, don't choose ASUS....
way better value than pretty much any and every tablet or laptop if you are not using any unique programs that probably wouldn't run well on an affordable computer anyways.As a Masters student I have a lot of documents that are convenient to be placed in google docs and this chromebook runs quickly and flawlessly for document work, web browsing, shopping online, netflix etc.EDIT: While this Chromebook was quite fast, light, and had good battery life, The screen suddenly cracked, I left it on the table, left, came back and there was a rectangular distortion on the upper left hand corner which quickly turned into an internal crack spanning the entire left side of the screen. I talked to customer service at ASUS and they told me to send it in, I told them that the damage is indeed physical, which is not covered by warranty, however since the physical damage occurred on its own under normal wear and tear (WITHIN 5 MONTHS!!) I thought they should honor their warranty. They told me to send it in and made a note of my comment, however they are now charging me $230 to repair a $200 chromebook. Apparently the screen alone is $150, and then there is labor, this means that the 2GB version of this Chromebook is only worth $19 while being assembled for free. ASUS is cheating me here, the Chromebook was faulty, however there is no way for me to prove it since the damage is physical, I paid $20 total for packaging and shipping to send it back for RMA and now they are asking $230 for a repair, and this is after I bought a $30 charger specifically for this Chromebook because the charger is unique to this model.I reccomend you avoid ASUS for their customer service and get the "Acer CB3-111 chromebook" instead, it has slightly less battery life, a bit heavier, however the screen is much more durable and the price is about the same. I will update if ASUS takes head of my dispute that i submitted and either charges me a reasonable amount (the screen replacement selling retail is only $70 at most so they could easily repair the computer for $10 labor which they charge + manufacture cost of the screen, probably around $30 or less) or simply honor the warranty.overall I would not reccomend this product to a friend because it is far too fragile, the screen may break just from opening the device...
