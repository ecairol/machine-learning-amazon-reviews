... months after dropping the last one (which worked much better than this one)
we've had this a few months after dropping the last one (which worked much better than this one).The wi-fi on this seems to cut out frequently where the old one did not. Sometimes webpages will hang completely where the old one did not.There is also a big problem with clicking on _anything_ using the touchpad. At first I was a bit skeptical when my wife described not being able to click on links half the time, but I have noticed it as well.....either doing a two finger (context menu) opening of the link or moving the cursor slightly with often "fix" the issue, but it's definitely a major flaw. I suspect it's just this unit as the previous one didn't have this issue.Battery is great and quite a value if these other issues weren't making it almost unusable.
