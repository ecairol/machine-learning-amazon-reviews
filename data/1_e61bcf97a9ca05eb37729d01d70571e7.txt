Awesome TV.
Awesome TV! Great picture. Awesome veiwing angle. This TV is huge! The remote doesn't have a qwerty keyboard like the m-series remotes, but that's fine. I didnt really need it anyways. The stand or legs of this TV are far apart. If your going to stand this TV up on a TV stand or something, the stand needs to be at least 4.5 feet long.
