You get what you pay for
You get what you pay for. Upon opening the box and turning the laptop on for the first time, I had to send it in to have the wifi card replaced. I received a replacement after 4 weeks but there are still issues with it connecting to the internet. Also, the replacement Asus sent me had a128GB SSD instead of the 256GB SSD that I purchased. Asus will not resolve the error they made in sending me a smaller SSD. Besides that, it is fairly quick, great battery life, and I like the non-reflective screen. Although, at random times the screen brightness will change. Also, the touch-pad is over-sized and loud. Would recommend spending the extra cash to purchase a Mac book Air for better construction and better customer service.
