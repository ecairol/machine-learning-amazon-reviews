Great performance in a small package
What a great little ultrabook, and I do mean little. The pictures provided don't do it justice. The unit is barely thicker than a USB port. The included USB to gigabit ethernet adapter is a nice thought but really unnecessary for most as the integrated wifi is plenty quick. Performance on this new intel process is great. The unit is zippy when it comes to playing back full 1080p video content and doesn't stutter at all with resource intense programs like adobe premier. I took this ultrabook on an extended 13 hour flight and still had 25% battery remaining when I landed and that was with WiFi enabled. Can't really ask for much more than that.
