Junk
This laptop would be perfect, if it wasn't for all the problems it gives. I had to send it in for repairs (stopped turning on) about 3 months after purchasing. Now 2 months after being repaired, it shuts down without warning every few days. Piece of junk. Will have to send it for repairs again soon
