Good, BUT not really
The computer is visually beautiful. Keyboard is nice and the screen does a great job keeping light from being reflected (matte finish). The only issue this computer has is the reason for the 2-star rating. The CPU usage maxes out at 100% as soon as I start using it. No programs are running and it still gets that high. This makes the computer extremely slow. Might have to return and buy a different computer.
