The track pad will drive you insane. The computer is usable with a track pad like this. Returning
This computer isn't horrible, however it is not great. For $699 the computer should be easy to use. The biggest issue I have with this laptop is the track pad. It is so bad, I mean unusable bad. I dread having to use my computer now because I know that the track pad will be such a hassle to use. I can barely track your movement, it's erratic and hard to control. Why you would think it is okay to have a track pad like this, I have no idea. This isn't a bottom of the line computer, this shouldn't be an issue. After having this computer for about a week I will probably end up returning it. I didn't buy a $699 laptop so that I could attach a mouse to it, and I don't think I can handle using the track pad for the next 3-4 years.Pros:Thin, light8GB of ram, 256GB ssdCons:Anything to do with the mouse. The clicker on the mouse pad is extremely loud and difficult to click. The track pad is a nightmare to use. Since you constantly use the mouse pad it is hard to ignore and deal with. I would not recommend this computer until they fix the track pad. I even though about sanding down the track pad in order to give my fingers more traction. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO THAT.
