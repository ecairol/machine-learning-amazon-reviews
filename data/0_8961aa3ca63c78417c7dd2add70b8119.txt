Wi-Fi Issues / Horribly Slow Internet Page Loading
I'm a Mac person, and this was my first computer outside of the MacBook line.  I am a grad student and needed to download SAS, a data coding program so I got a PC.  There are some nice qualities about this computer, but the issues (Wi-Fi) outweigh the benefits, sad to say...Internet quits out randomly and will not reconnect - during the same time, my phone and roommate's computers do not lose internet.  I have restarted the router, and taken the advice of the IT Crowd by "turning it off and on again" to no avail.  Even sitting right next to the router, the internet does not reconnect.  This has happened with multiple routers in multiple locations.  Even after I restarted the router, the Wi-Fi wouldn't show up, or after FIVE MINUTES it would show up again but the computer wouldn't automatically connect.Also, internet is very slow and usually shows a "webpage is not responding" message, and takes from five to ten seconds to load pages without multimedia.  On more than one occasion, I have been watching Netflix without any other tabs open or programs running, and the video froze for about ten seconds, or the sound quit out, or the program itself froze and the screen went black and I had to restart the computer.SOME PROS:- EXCELLENT battery life (7-8 hrs without battery saver mode)- Silent, no fan sound, doesn't heat up at all, brightness and screen good quality
