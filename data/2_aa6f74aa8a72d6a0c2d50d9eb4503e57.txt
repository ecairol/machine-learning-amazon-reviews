This is without a doubt the best computer of any kind I've owned
This is without a doubt the best computer of any kind I've owned.  The Solid State Drive  (SSD) is large enough for my needs (256 Gb).  If I need more memory for things like pictures,  I can buy an additional 32 Gb SD drive for $15-16.  Boot up is fast as my Android tablet--which is quick.  I love the lack of a fan and the ability to work in peaceful quietness.  I was not able to get the $699 on Amazon but Asus will sell you one directly--which is what I did.  It has 3 USB ports versus only 2 on the Acer Ultrabook the Asus replaced.  Great buy!
