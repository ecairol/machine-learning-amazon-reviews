CANT GET HELP
Item started going bad 7 months post purchase.  Heath checks showing "Caution due to reallocated sectors count".  Machine hardly has anything loaded to it.  We had to restore to factory defaults.  Laptop runs incredibly slow.  Takes 30 minutes or more just to boot up (you can imagine the frustration).  Lenovo is advising us to contact the seller.  If not, they're 'willing' to refurbish it (note that it's still under warranty).  Not sure why I can't just get a replacement since it's clear that the hard drive was likely defective from the start.  Trying to find help from Amazon, Lenovo or Cross Distributors (the seller).  Wish I had just walked into a Best Buy or something at this point so I would have one contact instead of multiple run-arounds.
