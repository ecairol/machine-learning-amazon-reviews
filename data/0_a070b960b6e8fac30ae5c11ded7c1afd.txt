It is very cheaply made.  It does not have a solid feel to it.  I was very disappointed that a cd burner was not included.  I cannot download existing software without attaching a cd or dvd device to it which adds to the cost of the laptop.  I would not purchase one like it again.  I will probably purchase another brand.
