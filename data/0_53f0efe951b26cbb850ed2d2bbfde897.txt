Problems out of the box, exchanging for a different brand
Had problems from the minute I pulled it out of the box.  The system clock is actually moving backwards and does not keep time even after resetting it manually, causing issues with various files. Online video streaming keeps cutting out so I need to reload the player every few minutes.Asus customer service is speedy, but unhelpful. I've given up after a few days and plan to return this computer for a replacement.
