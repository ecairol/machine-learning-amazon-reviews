The computer is just OK, customer support is GREAT!
I bought this laptop (Asus calls it a notebook), because I needed a device that had USB ports so I could program remote controls in the field. The USB ports failed after 4 months. I called Asus support, who by the way are excellent, and tried about five different things including reinstalling the BOIS. Nothing worked so on my 3rd. call to them they suggested a total system reset and assured me that would fix the problem. It didn't. So now I guess I will be sending it back to get a replacement. Asus support is EXCELLENT. It's not their fault the computer is defective. I'm certain I will be able to get a new computer because when I purchased it through Amazon.com it came with a 1 year guarantee against fire, water, dropping, or any other mishap that might happen, plus it's still in warranty. One thing I hate about this computer other than Windows 8.1 is you have to hold down the function key and volume up/down to adjust the volume. Really? Two fingers to adjust the volume? Plus these keys are on opposite ends of the keyboard, a really poor design. The battery life seemed to shorten considerably since I purchased it. At first it lasted about 7 hours, 10.5 months later I only get about 3 hours out of it. All in all it's about what I expected from a $200 computer. If you just need a basic computer it's not bad.
