The little thing worked great and typed nicely
The little thing worked great and typed nicely, and that said from someone who doesn't enjoy laptop keyboards; HOWEVER, I've had it only a few weeks, and all of a sudden it tells me my Gmail password can't be verified and it wants an old password, which I don't believe exists unless it was something factory installed.  I tried logging into my Gmail acct on my PC and there was no problem with passwords.  I looked up the problem, and there are reported problems of the exact same nature dating back to 2014.  So they know of this issue and haven't repaired it in a year.  I only browsed the internet with this chromebook because my old PC is slow due to being bombarded with ads and cookie tracing.  Got tired of trying to read an article only to have something insult my eardrums or block my view.  But some people in the forum I was reading lost important files when they gave the chromebook an old password.  It troubles me because I don't know if this is ASUS Chinese hacks, Google trying to sell cloud storage, or just a glitch in the system.  Hopefully the latter.  So many great reviews I read here, so I wanted to let others know of this issue.
