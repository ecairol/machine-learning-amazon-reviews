Good basic computer - small & sleek, with minor design flaws
So far, so good.  My only gripe is that the speakers are on the bottom!  This means that if I'm not using headphones, the sound is muffled.  That's pretty poor design if you ask me.  Otherwise, definitely worth the price!  Great size, small and sleek.  Keyboard is a little cramped, but that would be the case for any computer this size.  Also, I wish the keyboard lit up.Windows 8, once you get used to it (which I had for work), isn't that bad to navigate.  This computer is fast, and so far has been treating me well.  Battery life is good, graphics look good.
