Cracked screen in less than 1 & 1/2 years of use!
I adore this new iPad. Shipping was very fast also - it got here in a couple days. I replaced an iPad 2 with this new Air tablet. I have to wonder if it's as sturdy though. I've had it a little over a year & the screen has cracked; almost more like 'crumbled' in my hand! I have no idea why, unless it was faulty from the beginning. I've never dropped it, it's always in a case and though I use it a lot, it's mostly for reading books & playing a few games. I don't understand why the screen broke so easily! It's still working, I have to give it that. I did put some clear tape on it. I'm so bummed, though! I paid $800 for this only about 17 months ago and it doesn't seem like it should've broken like this so quickly. <sigh>  RS
