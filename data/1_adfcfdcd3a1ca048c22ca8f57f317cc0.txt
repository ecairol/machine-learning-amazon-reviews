Not so bad, ok for teens and students  but lot of glitches if you want to use it for work or play
Its ok - because honestly Windows 8 seems to designed for laptop with touchscreen and this one doesn't have it...And nice features like that drawing program doesn't make sense, because instruction says " move your finger on screen" "pinch with 2 fingers to zoom" etc... Kidding  me? If you selling pc without touchscreen, why make programs works only with touchscreen?Office trial doesn't make sense either, but surprisingly I able to install OpenOffice without problems. And InkScape works!Somehow Avast slows Internet down, which NOT happened in Windows 7.... Glitch of Windows 8?And some sites like change.org looks like lifeless pages with non-working buttons...But after hard work you can fix some glitches, so laptop still ok.Light-weight.I can say, I wish there was more USB ports because no DVD rom... but, well.... cant change that.
