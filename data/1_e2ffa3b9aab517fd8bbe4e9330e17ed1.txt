It's ok. The keyboard seems a little strange and my wife had some trouble adjusting to the keys. Also, the alignment of the mouse pad is slightly to the left of center to accomodate the full size number keys to the right of the qwerty keyboard. . It's not a big deal but, she asked that I return it.The computer seemed fast enough and had it not been for the layout of the keys, we probably would have kept it.
