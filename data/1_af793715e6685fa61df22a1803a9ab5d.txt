Asus Zenbook UX305LA (gold)
I got this laptop two weeks ago, so far, everything is working great! I only use the laptop a couple hours each day when I am at home to do homework, so far, I have only charged it 3 times. I am still not sure if the battery really last 12 hours. I tried google chrome-cast, and the laptop fan started running (like what always happens on my older laptop, so it's no big deal). Even when the fan starts up, it's still really quiet. It starts up and runs everything extremely fast (so fast that I feel spoiled). It is also extremely light-weighted, I can easily take it everywhere with one hand. The screen resolution is nice and crisp, no weird mustard-yellow color (I read about Asus having problems with some of its laptops). I saw some reviews about this laptop having wi-fi issues, I haven't encountered any problems. My last laptop, I kept getting disconnected, but this zenbook hasn't disconnected me at all.The only small complaints I have:1) Keyboard: you have to press hard (harder than my old laptop) for it to sense it, maybe I just need to get used to it.2) The power charging cord is really short3) The battery status on the screen would tell me different battery time remaining sometimes, even if it's only a couple seconds from the last time I checked (not sure if it's estimating based on my workload or not)Overall: I really recommend this laptop. For the price, it's a steal! Plus the color is really pretty. It says gold, but it's leaning towards rose gold. I am a girl, so no complaints there.
