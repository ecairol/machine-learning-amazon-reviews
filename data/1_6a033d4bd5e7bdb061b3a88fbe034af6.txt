I liked the look
I got this zenbook labtop about 7 months ago. I liked the look, and light-weight, of course, the low price. But recently, I have found some issues, got me concerned about the quality of the product.1. from time to time, my IE (internet explorer) will show complete blank, when that happens, even I go to another website, it's still blank. I don't know what happened, chrome seems to be fine. But it got me wonder about the QA process of Asus products.2. I just bought this Sony Bluetooth speaker (shaped like a tennis ball), and I have difficulty connecting to it. my wife's Apple Mac Air was able to connect to it right away. And that gave her a chance to brag about her hardware electronics skill over me. That hurts! Because, if it's not hardware electronics skill, It's definitely my hardware purchase skill!!3. So I connected the Sony speaker with a audio cable, at least that worked, but I heard this intermittent noise. I thought it's the speaker, but when I disconnected it, I found it's the PC itself! I tried two different video source on the internet, both got the same noise. Once I restart the PC, the problem was gone. But this experience again gave me a bad feeling about this Zenbook.Will have to wait and see, I will do more extensive testing on this device. Can't trust Asus no more.
