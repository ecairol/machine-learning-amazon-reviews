Great picture, great value. Love this TV.
Our LG tv went poof while we were watching the news and while it was under an extended warranty, the wait time for a tech was a couple of weeks. We went in search of a replacement and figured we'd put the repaired TV in the bedroom. Shopping for a TV is a difficult thing to do. One review says it's wonderful, another says stay away. We read about light leaks, bleeding color, bad black colors and all these things that in the old days no one had to think about. My parents just chose a screen size and came home with the TV. It's all very complicated now. All we wanted was a 50 inch TV that would give us a good picture and did not break the bank. After reading a lot of reviews, we chose this one because it was inexpensive and opinions were generally very good.It arrived in an outer box filled with packing materials that were triangular shaped pieces of cardboard. After we took the TV out of the large, outer box, our cat ran in there and treated it like a bounce house kicking and jumping all over the pieces. I was able to easily lift the TV, put it on the entertainment center and connect everything. We changed the display to Dynamic (I think) and made a few adjustments to individual settings and are very pleased with the purchase.One thing to keep in mind: Many TVs have the stand in the center so are only limited by the size of your entertainment center. What I mean is, if you have a 40 inch wide object with a 20 inch stand in the center, you could get away with putting it on a 24 inch tabletop because the entire stand would be accommodated. This television has the feet on the extreme edges so make sure you measure the width of your TV stand before ordering to ensure it fits.
