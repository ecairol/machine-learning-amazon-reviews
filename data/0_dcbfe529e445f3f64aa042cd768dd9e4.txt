Very slow
This computer is very slow.  Also it comes with Windows 8.1 which is horrible and has a lot of apps installed that I do not want.  Even though it was cheap, I'm sorry I bought it.  The reviews when I bought were all good.  It replaced a 7 year old computer and is barely faster plus Windows Vista is much more user friendly than Windows 8.1. I do like the touch pad - it's much easier to use than most but it doesn't make up for the slow speed.
