Doh!
Really disappointed...the laptop had amazing specs for the price, free upgrade to win10, and great design. She froze twice while installing updates which, believe it or not, can be a normal occurrence so i finished the process. I got about 2 hours use before the laptop wouldn't boot. I confirmed the battery is charging along with hdd activity (blue and green indicator lights) but nothing on my screen. Also worth mentioning that my 256 SSD was partitioned in two. I had roughly 100gb on the C drive and 150gb on the D drive. I'm not sure why it was shipped this way but I would have definitely preferred a single partition. Nothing you can do about this after the OS is installed. Package is sitting by the door, waiting to be picked up by UPS...Two stars because I received the laptop in one or two business days which is insanely fast. I also really liked the design along with the specs... 950m, 256SSD, 8gb ram and i7! Pretty great for 800 smackaroos but i guess you get what you pay for. Might have been caused by the inadequate packaging. Shipped in a large box with a single brown paper on one side??
