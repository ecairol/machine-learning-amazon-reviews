Bought this a while ago but never used it. After a few times of use, the delete button stopped working as did the "t" letter.Tried to return but can't. If I had used it hard since I bought it, i wouldn't mind, but I used this 4 hours max since I have it.So, very unhappy about the quality. If you decide to purchase this, make sure to use it a lot before the 30 return policy expires.
