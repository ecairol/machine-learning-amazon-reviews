Disappointed.
Returned it.I sold my iPad 4th Gen to a family member and upgraded to this.  Was really unhappy with the build quality, mainly the screen.  It was enough where I decided to return the iPad.  Sensitivity seemed off, the screen felt "hollow" when I tapped on it... it just didn't feel like it was as well built as the 4th gen I came from.I've been an apple device user since 2007- this was my second iPad I've owned.  I was worried about Apples product quality with the passing of Mr. Jobs and this iPad is no exception.  I was surprised how "flimsy" this felt.
