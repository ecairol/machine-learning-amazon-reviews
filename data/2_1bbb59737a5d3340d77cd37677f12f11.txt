Good Value
This laptop was very affordable, loaded with features and most of all, fast to use. My needs were internet surfing, email and wordl processing, which have all been quick and reliable. I was most impressed when I connected my Brother printer/fax/scanner and the laptop automatically obtained a driver. So far, a reliable and speedy laptop.
