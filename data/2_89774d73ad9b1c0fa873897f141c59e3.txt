So nice that I bought 2!
Fantastic laptop, especially for the price. I got 2 of these laptops, both for less than $140 each. You can't beat that! I originally purchased one for my mother and it was so nice that I got one for my wife as well. They are pretty basic in terms of features, but again, these are extremely affordable. The screen gets bright, the speakers are loud, keyboard is good, and the trackpad is great. That last bit is very important to me. Good trackpads are hard to find on PCs in general so I'm very happy that ASUS knows what they are doing. My personal machine is a higher end ASUS laptop and it has the best trackpad I've ever used besides a Mac. Very glad to see that the quality doesn't immediately drop off, even though the price does. Also worth mentioning is the charger. It's extremely small, almost like a phone charger, making it very portable. The one thing that I had to take a star off for is the optical drive. I understand it not coming with one, but having the slot with a cover over it is very confusing. It looks as though it has one but it does not. One review I read was very negative because of this. He felt the drive had no button and that he was sent a defective product, when in fact it does not have a drive at all. But I digress...This laptop is great for basic users or children. It's made well and very affordable.TL;DRIt's cheap, but not crappy. Buy it! You can always return later...But I won't be returning either of the 2 I bought.
