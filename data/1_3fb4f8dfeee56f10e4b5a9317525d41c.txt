It runs really fast as I expected when I bought it. the keyboard is fit and comfortable, the laptop as a whole is small and light with nice design. It can also play game smoothly. However, I have some problems with it are that there is no short key on the keyboard to skip song or pause, the battery is not very long. But for $750, this laptop is a good deal.
