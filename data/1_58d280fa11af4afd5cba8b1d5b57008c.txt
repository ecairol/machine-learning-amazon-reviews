Can't beat it for the price and quality!
We bought this for our 13 year old for Christmas - all she wanted was a laptop. Did research and the price was outstanding. It does have a lot of junk on it and she says it's slower than hoped but for the price, it does the job. Put McAfee on it instead of the 30 day Norton trial antivirus software.
