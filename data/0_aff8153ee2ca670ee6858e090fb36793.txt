A huge problem was the Windows 8 OS, and for that ASUS should not utterly escape blame.  I was setting up the email for my wife and the system demanded that I prove my wife's identity.  To that end they said they were sending my wife an email message with a code on it.  How was I to see this code since I had yet to set her email up -- a Catch 22 problem.  My only alternative seems to be to install an email system for my wife on a computer with an older OS so that the ASUS email system can send it the code.
