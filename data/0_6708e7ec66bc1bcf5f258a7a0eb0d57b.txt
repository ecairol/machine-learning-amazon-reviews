I hated it out of the box, but is fine as long as you reformat and reinstall the OS and necessary drivers only.
Even though my review says "I hate it", allow me to explain.  If you order this and have no technical skills related to reloading the operating system from scratch, you will have a laptop that is practically unusable.  As you may have read from other reviews, the CPU usage is frequently at 100% when the laptop is idle.  That makes it impossible to navigate.  This is due to the ridiculous amount of "bloatware" that comes preinstalled.  I've been a computer tech since 1989 so I knew what I was going to do with this laptop that day I ordered it.  I reformatted the hard drive and installed Windows 7 Pro, all the MS updates, and only the necessary drivers.  The laptop is now fine and at $250 a good deal for me.  Had I not known how to do this, I would have returned the laptop to the seller.  I am attaching a screen shot of the installed programs which is drastically reduced from what it came with.  I had read other reviews on this laptop where people said they love it, it's quick, etc.  I don't believe them, there is no way out of the box that this laptop is quick without doing what I did.
