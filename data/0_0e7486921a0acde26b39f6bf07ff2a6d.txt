Sometimes You Don't Even Get What You Pay For
This is a terrible computer, even for someone who is not technically literate. My husband is a basic user, email, FB and browsing and this computer doesn't have the RAM to handle those minimal functions. Purchased from a big box retailer 3 days ago, it took 2 FULL days to download Windows 10. It seems that Windows 10 requires too much memory and the computer has become slow; so slow in fact that it is slower than the Toshiba Satellite running Vista that he bought 7 YEARS ago. (Ex. From the start menu, I clicked on Edge, it took 9 seconds to open and another 6 seconds to be able to type in the address bar. From the bottom menu I clicked on the documents icon, it took 5 seconds to open and it is empty! How long would it take to open once it is full of documents???)I certainly didn't have high expectations for a computer costing $266, but I did expect it to be able to open email and web pages without crashing. Yes, it has crashed 3 times and he has only been using it for 2 hours.I agree with what other reviewers have said, it is slow right out of the box, but once upgraded to Windows 10, it becomes so annoyingly slow that it gives the feel that you're using dial up-even to open a document. It is being packaged up and returned to the store. I have owned Toshiba laptops since 2004 and each one has lasted at least 5 years; I'm very disappointed that their quality has gone down.The construction is also very shoddy. You must be careful when repositioning the screen while using because the entire bottom half will rise up as you try to push the screen backwards.The screen graphics and text are pixilated making for a low quality visual experience.Please do not torture yourself and purchase this piece of junk.
