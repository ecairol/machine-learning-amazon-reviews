The computer runs great, as expected
Bought as a christmas gift to my daughter.  The computer runs great, as expected.  The only complaint I have is with the mouse.  There are no left/right click buttons, so it takes some getting used to (pushing the entire trackpad down to click).  The solution to that was a wireless mouse.
