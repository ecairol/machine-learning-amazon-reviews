but that's a 'I don't like it', and it's not quite that bad
As the 3 stars say, 'it's ok'. I want to go a little lower, with 2, but that's a 'I don't like it', and it's not quite that bad.The Pros...The cost. The very low price is almost a steal. Now with the low cost, you are going to lose several important benefits.Weight. Super light.Reasonable speed. No, I doubt you will be able to run Photoshop or other intensive programs.Plenty of ports. Well, not plenty. But they are all there. You have your Ethernet, VGA, HDMI, and 2 USB ports (only one each for 2.0 &3.0).The Cons...NO RE-MOVEABLE BATTERY. WTF? Really?NO CD/DVD drive. Meh. I'll live. Tech is going to a download-only trend anyways... But sorta scares me to see how to fix thing when the OS failsNO access for anything. Memory, battery. You name it, it's locked down (which can be good).Windows 8.1 with Bing. Not necessarily a bad thing. Keeps the price of the laptop down. It doesn't shove Bing down your throat. You can use other search stuff on you PC. Search "Windows 8.1 with Bing" and HowToGeek explains it nicely.Cheap plastic feel, but it works nicely.Power supply. I am really concerned about it. It is tiny. No ground on it too. But they are the engineers.No way to upgrade anything.
