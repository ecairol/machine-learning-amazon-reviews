No CD or DVD drive...Beware!
This laptop was a good buy for the money...or so I thought!  My son asks me today how to open up the DVD drive because there isn't a button to open it.  Come to find out there is NO DVD drive!  I guess I just assumed that all laptops come with one!  Even after reading all the reviews not one person mentioned it didn't have an internal DVD/cd drive!  Well, motto of the story is you get what you pay for!  So today I was stuck with ordering an external one!  Not cool!
