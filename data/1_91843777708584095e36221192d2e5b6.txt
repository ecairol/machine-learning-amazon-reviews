I love this notebook
I love this notebook. Lightweight, fast and perfect for the simple stuff I do using the Internet. I have a fast desktop machine, an old laptop and an anemic iPad 2. I needed to get something I could use on the go without pulling out my hair due to poor speed or a worn out touchpad. This was the solution.My only complaint arose when the touchpad stopped working correctly about one week into owning it. ASUS tech support was helpful and fixed it with a system reset. For the money, this notebook is a great value.
