Low Quality & Lousy Service
UPDATE: Replacement Failed Too!And just 60 days after a replacement, the new one has failed as well.This time a complete failure of the OS and inability to reinstall it. Back to Amazon it goes (sorry)After just 90 days, the lower left 1/3 of the keyboard died rendering this chrome book useless.This is a real problem because it was in daily use with my 14-year-old as he started high school.Getting service from ASUS was a challenge as well. It took three calls and an escalation before they would issue an RMA and allow me to hand carry it to their service center.It has now been more than a week and it is still not repaired. Apparently they do not have the parts to fix the device.End of the day? Stay away from ASUS, their products are disposable and apparently so are the customers.
