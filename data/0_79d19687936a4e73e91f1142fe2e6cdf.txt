ASUS Cheapbook
I was looking for a new laptop before I went off to college and read an article stating that this was the "best student laptop" around, so I decided to give it a shot. Terrible choice......first off, it's slower than my old laptop (an HP Pavilion which has almost no processing power...that just makes no sense).Secondly, the track pad is AWFUL. It barely responds to your movements and makes the loudest, most irritating clicking noise you could imagine. Very distracting.Also, the speakers sounded as if they were broken. Not only that, their sound was just terrible to begin with. I had to bump them up to 100 just to hear ANYTHING. Crackly sound, bumps galore...just terrible.Then there was all of the crapware that was installed on it when I got it. Just unnecessary junk that fills your hard drive and slows the computer down.Anyways, I returned it, got a full refund, and invested about $150 more for an HP Spectre which is 100x better in every sense. Great speakers, great track pad, incredibly fast, absolutely NO crapware. Highly recommended.
