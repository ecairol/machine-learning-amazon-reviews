Great price for an ultrabook
Overall, it's a really nice laptop, but with the price I got it for (discounted on Microsoft) it makes a great laptop.  I don't have anything really new to add to others review.  It's a real ultrabook that actually comes with a hefty amount of memory.Main cons for me include1. the SD card slot is shallow, so the card sticks out like a USB drive.  This is a big bummer for me.  I bought a 128g SD card just to supplement, but can't leave it installed.2. runs a little slow considering that I don't even use a lot of complicated software3. power and delete button is in an odd place but hasn't bothered me yet4. wifi seems slower than what I'm used toOverall, still a really good deal for a super portable device.  I take it with me everywhere and would definitely recommend it.
