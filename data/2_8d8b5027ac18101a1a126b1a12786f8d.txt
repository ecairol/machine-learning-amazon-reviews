Nice compact little computer
So far so good on this small sized laptop. It is thin and very lightweight to carry.The screen is attractive, and I like the touchpad as well as any I've used, and better than most.What I liked BEST is that there wasn't a lot of junk installed that I had to take the time to uninstall. I think I un-installed four things, and on a new computer, I'd say I normally install 10-15 junk applications as I set up. It come with McAfee AV, which is set up and ready to use. You just need to activate it. Outside of installing my applications, I had this hooked up to wireless, desktop icons to my taste, junk apps gone, and ready to go in about 15 minutes.Due to the sold state drive, it boots almost instantly ... really nice.There are some laptop/tablet hybrids with touch screens at similar price points, so if that is your thing, then you can do better than this. I'm not a fan of tablets or touch screens, so for me this is as good as one of those units.Recommended.
