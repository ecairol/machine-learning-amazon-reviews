I bought this laptop on August, 2015 and is already broken. The screen is freeze. I never had this situation with any other laptop bought it because the remarks but I do not recommend this device I am given just 1 star because the is no zero. Also is impossible to get help not from Amazon non from ASUS this is the worse experience ever. BEWARE UPDATE I SENT IT FOR REPAIR TO ASUS EVEN THOUGHT THAT IS UNDER WARRANTY THEY SENT IT BACK TO ME AFTER 1 MONTH 1/2 THEY TOLD ME WAS OUT OF WARRANTY I AM FILING A COMPLAINT VERY BAD BAD
