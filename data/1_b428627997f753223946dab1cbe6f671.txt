Decent computer, great price
For a very modestly priced computer this seems more than adequate. Although the construction is not comparable to that of a first-quality laptop it seems sturdy enough for most purposes. The keyboard is comfortable to use, and the speed, while not top of the line, is fine for routine tasks. Seems like a good buy so far.
