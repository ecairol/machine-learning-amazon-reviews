ASUS Zenbook UX305LA 13.3-Inch Laptop (Intel Core i5, 8GB, 256 GB SSD, Titanium Gold) with Windows 10
I am writing this review on this laptop as you read this. First off I need to start by saying that I was a Apple/Mac guy for years. I finally made the switch the PC/Android and this laptop was the perfect choice.If you're looking to compare this to other laptops you may be considering for purchase this laptop is along the lines of a MacBook Air. You do give up 250gb of internal memory, but I'll take the 8gb RAM in return. This computer is just as light, if not lighter than the Air. It also has all of the ports you may need to function as an everyday computer user. I use mine for standard college student tasks, but it can run some solid programs if needed. As a person that isn't a computer genius, but needs to get plenty of work done this laptop is perfect! Did i mention it's roughly $300-$600 less than a comparable Mac?
