Wonderful laptop
This ASUS is amazing, it starts within seconds, loads things faster than my tower computer, and is great at connecting to wifi.Keyboard/Track padThe keyboard doesn't light up but I hardly ever notice since the screen lights up the keys enough anyways.The track pad will be a little slow and lagging at first, but after less than an hour of use it should be fine. Even though I hate track pads this one works very well and is better than most.AdapterIt also comes with 2.0 USB Ethernet adapter, which works fine but is only a 2.0 so it's hardly any faster than wifi. It still helps with downloading large things but if you really want to boost your connection get a 3.0 adapter.SpeakersAnother thing is the speakers, while they're not super amazing they're probably the best built in laptop speakers around.ConsThe one and only real downside is Windows 8, but with time you'll get to upgrade to Windows 10 so it's not that big of a deal. Another part I'm not a huge fan of is that it comes with McAfee as the security tool, but that's just my opinion.Buy itStill this is, overall, a great laptop and I would suggest it to anyone that wants a new laptop.
