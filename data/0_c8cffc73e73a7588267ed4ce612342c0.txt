Beware of adaptive brightness ! it's auto and theres no control !
Would you ever buy a screen of any sorts that every other second ajusted the brightness either up or down quite noticeably? It's called "adaptive brightness" or DBC in forums on the net. There's no work around - in the bios or in windows, as it is a built in firmware in the screen. Dell says it's to save battery power, but that's what the ajustable brightness in windows is for dear Dell ;-)Now after bios A07 you still can't turn it off - so no calibration of the screen and still the constant dimming/changing of the brightness.It is really a shame and an unforgivable (arrogant) mistake from Dell on a high-end'ish laptop, because the laptop with its low weight and design is actually quite nice...
