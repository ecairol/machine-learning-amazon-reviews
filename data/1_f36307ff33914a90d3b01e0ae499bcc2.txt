Like all but one thing
I like Pretty much like everything about this laptop, I have some personal preferences that this laptop didn't include but i'm fine with that. The only reason this doesn't have five stars is because the laptop has a problem with the speakers, it keeps switching to headphones setting even though i have never put headphones into this computer. I have had this laptop for about 5 days and it actually did that the first day i used it, its pretty frustrating when i'm trying to listen to music and the sound cuts out multiple times during one song, then i have to manually change the setting from headphones to internal speaker. I would be a much happier customer if the speakers worked properly.
