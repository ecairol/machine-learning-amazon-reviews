Terrible Customer Service, buy a New One, Have a Problem, Get a Refurbished Unit of less Quality
Beware of ASUS.  I purchased a different ASUS transformer which first had problems after three months.  The unit was "repaired" and returned.  It then had the same problem several months later.  To make a long story short, the unit was "repaired" four times (and still didn't work properly) before ASUS replaced it with a refurbished unit with less memory.  Because I foolishly believed that the unit had actually been repaired each time, I downloaded the Office software each time I got the unit back.  Now, I've exceeded the allowed number of downloads and will have to purchase Office.  ASUS refused to help with this problem.  If you purchase a new unit, be prepared to end up with a lesser, refurbished one if you have problems and extremely unhelpful customer service.
