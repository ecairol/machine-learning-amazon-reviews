Decent, but there are better options.
Does not come with an optical drive - looks like they're making that pretty clear now, but when I bought one there were pictures of an optical drive with a disc.There is just a plastic space where the optical drive would be - but to remove this spacer and install a DVD-RW drive, or a caddy to hold a hard drive or SSD (there is a SATA port under there) you have to take the whole laptop apart. It's screwed in, and the screw is internal. Very annoying and a bad design.The battery is also internal and you have to take the whole thing apart to get to that too.It comes with Windows 8.1 but no sticker with a key, so if you need to re-install the OS, be sure to use a software tool to find your Windows key number first.Screen is fairly low resolution - the standard inexpensive notebook screen. No surprise at this price though, it's reasonable.You do get a lot for the money, but there are better choices - several other brands offer $250 laptops with the same specs. Another brand that also starts with A has one that is thinner and the plastic spacer where the optical drive goes can be easily removed with 1 screw on the bottom on the unit.One advantage of this unit is that it has the numeric keypad on the keyboard, and some of the $250 models from other brands do not.
