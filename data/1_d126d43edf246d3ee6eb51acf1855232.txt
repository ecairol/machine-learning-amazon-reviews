Ok Laptop, but look closely
I have here a laptop in which I have mixed feelings about, Why mixed feelings?Let me tell you that on the PLUS side  This laptop has an excellent design  VERY low price  Nice size  VGA PortBut the cons are also important  Has a Celeron N2830 CPU  No optical drive  No bluetooth  Only 2 USB Ports  Integrated BatteryThe CPU, the Celeron N2830 is the "New" Atom processor, you might remember the netbook, years back, like the Acer Aspire One series. It's a very slow processor. In speed terms, i would say it's around the speed of the core2duo.Connectivity wise it has two USB ports, there's one USB 2.0 and the other is 3.0. Luckily it has HDMI and VGA port so you can use your old monitor lying around and/or hook it up to your TV.The bay is there for the optical drive, but maybe for cutting costs, it wasn't installed.I wouldn't recommend this laptop to someone who will really depend on it, this is more like a first laptop for a child, elderly, or as a backup.Who I would recommend this laptop to is to someone looking at Chromebooks, we all know they are not the best value, and you can always install any Linux OS on this laptop and it will run better than Windows 8.1 or any chromebook. I installed Linux Mint and works excellent.
