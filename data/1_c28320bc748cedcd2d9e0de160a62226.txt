You'll love it!
We purchased this for our college-age daughter to replace a Sony laptop running Windows 7. We were looking for something she could complete her homework on but would also be helpful after graduation. I researched the Pentium N3520 processor vs. an i3, and the experts all agreed that they are pretty much the same thing.She loves her Yoga! It's perfect as a laptop for word processing, and perfect as a tablet for social networking, videos and movies. The size is perfect--just a little bigger than an ipad, and big enough for keyboarding. It took her a few days to master Windows 8, but after a couple of YouTube tutorials, she's an expert. I also bought this on Amazon for $100 less than it was advertised at Best Buy.I highly recommend for anyone who needs the convenience of a tablet and the practicality of a laptop.
