Overall very pleased. A few complaints:-the laptop is not grey, it is a greyish purple color-when flipped open the bottom of the top screen rests on the table, not the studs designed for it to rest on- you need to be used to a matte screen, its nice once you get used to it but makes the screen seem a little weird at firstPros:-very light, amazingly slim and feels sturdy for its size-it has a feature that allows it to start up in about 5 seconds(also if you buy it on Microsoft you get the windows 10 already installed on it for you)really great buy for the price, I couldn't find anything else with these specs at this price, now we'll just have to wait and see how it holds up on the long term!- clear screen
