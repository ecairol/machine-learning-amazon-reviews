Faulty product - dead pixels on half the screen and worst Toshiba customer support!
Dead pixels on half the screen (see image) after couple of months of usage. Product is under one year warranty - but when I called Toshiba Customer support I was asked to first send them an email with images of the issue. After sending the email and waiting for 3 days, someone called me from Toshiba and asked me to call the Toshiba Depot Center and they would take care of it. Called them and the person on the line said I would have to pay for any service provided even though the product is under warranty!!! Called Toshiba again and now they claimed that screen/pixel issues are NOT covered by the warranty (they lied to me the first time) - just feel they are giving customers the run around for a defective product! They took down my complaint again and asked me to call again next week! The saga continues... will never buy a Toshiba product again
