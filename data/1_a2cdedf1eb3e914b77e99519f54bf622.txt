Great notebook
Love it! It just arrived today and so far everything is great. I'm having a little trouble installing Windows 10 though. The first attempt failed due to some obscure update I was missing. I went to the Asus website and  downloaded the Windows 10 upgrade directly from the website. So far so good. It's almost downloaded but I have burned through the better part of the day doing this!  Hope it works! May have to revise this rating  however if the second attempt isn't successful.
