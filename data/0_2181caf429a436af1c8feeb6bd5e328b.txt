My XPS13 constantly returns double characters for a single keyboard stroke. It is useless for typing which is why I got a laptop instead of an iPAD. It's probably one of the worst devices I've ever owned. Seriously, look elsewhere if you need a functional keyboard./I'm off to update my BIOS, drives, etc... What a grand adventure. (This is most likely the last Dell I will own.)Update: upgrading to the latest 05 BIOS did not resolve the problem, but it may have helped a bit.Update: OMG this laptop keyboard sucks so bad. Kill me now.
