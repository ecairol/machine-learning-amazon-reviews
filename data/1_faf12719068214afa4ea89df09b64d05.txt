Cheap laptop does the job, but with two 250 GB drives.
Pros:Cheap - really, really cheap.  This was the cheapest, usable laptop I could find when I bought it.Size - the keyboard and screen are both nice and big (I prefer big).  I guess it might be too big and heavy for some people, but it's not an issue for me.  I use my laptops as pseudo-desktops, so I'm not jetting around with a laptop bag or anything.Consistency - I've never really had a PROBLEM with the machine.  It's randomly frozen three or four times, and then it'll chug if I throw a big computational operation at it.  But that said, the thing works.Cons:Hard Drive Memory - it might say so in the specs, but it's not actually 500 GB, it's two 250 GB internal hard drives.  So yes, you get 500 GB, but on separate drives.  I guess it's not a huge deal, but I just don't like switching back and fourth, and I hate working off the secondary (I only use the secondary to backup some important stuff).  This is probably the biggest reason it gets a star knocked off.Technology - meh, it would be a higher quality machine in about 2005 or 2006 (so ten year old tech).  Which is fine if you're just surfing the web, using MS Office (Word, Excel, etc).  MATLAB runs fine on this machine.  It's not gonna play any new games, but it plays 10 year old games fairly well (will play Company of Heroes on lower graphics settings).  Can't run too many programs at the same time.Pre-Installed Stuff - Windows 8.1 is okay, I preferred 7.  But MS offers a free update to 10 (which is supposed to be better).  Comes with some bloatware of bloatware (pre-loaded programs you'll never use), but better than most retail computers.Battery - I think the run time is more like 3 or 4 hours (not the five that's stated in the specs).  And I run at lowest power usage when unplugged.  But as stated, I don't really use my laptops as mobile computers.
