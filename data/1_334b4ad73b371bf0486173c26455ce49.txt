I could have easily rated it a four of five
I could have easily rated it a four of five, but the system is sometimes slow and sluggish; even when I use my home router - which is secured and not available to others, like the local WiFi hubs. I use Linux, but I still need more RAM for quicker operations. Thank you for the Lenovo computer. Overall, I like it a lot. It will serve me well once I install more RAM.
