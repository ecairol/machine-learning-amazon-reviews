Five Stars
Needs some modification to software on arrival but runs quick.Update 1: it's been a month using the Zenbook and I can't compare it to my last laptop. Quick for all uses (school work), silent and feels like a high end computer. I have not had an issue with the power button and delete button at all. I did change the function of the button if it is hit on accident.
