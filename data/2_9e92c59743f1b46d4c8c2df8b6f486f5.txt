Love it!
I ordered this specifically for schoolwork. I am obtaining a bachelor's degree (fully online). I am taking five classes right now so I needed something fast, light, inexpensive, and a long battery life. This Chromebook is all of those things!The only issue that has come about so far is some incompatibility between documents my professors post in the .doc or .docx format. I am working on downloading an app that will hopefully help to provide a solution to that.The app store holds several awesome apps - endless possibilities.Start up is instant, battery life is truly as it is stated (all day).I am loving the Google cloud, Google docs, etc.
