Don't believe the hype of Windows 8 and this device
Zero stars if i could. rate it that low.  A typical Windows piece of junk.  i have had this for several months and can state unequivocally that the whole Windows 8 is another failure.  Dropping of wifi connections, Crashing due to Adobe Flash issues.  Poorly responsive track pad.A bloated operating system. The one decent thing Windows had was the "Start" icon to view programs quickly.  Guess what , it is gone on Windows 8.  Nice going Microsoft.  You can run all the fancy commercials you want, touting the touch capability and swiping.  I know the truth. I only bought it for some job requirements that were Windows only.  I fight with it daily.  I have taken it out of my office and it is being reduced to only some very isolated Windows tasks.  Otherwise I was ready to throw it out on I-95 on my way home.  I am getting a MacBook Pro.Another novel thing the Lenovo did was that as soon as I turned it on, my home printer would mysteriously start up and spew out gibberish pages for no reason. I thought the printer was bad until i realized this crappy computer was sending out the erroneous messages.  i deleted the printer and this never has happened again.I did buy a MacBook Pro (refurbished from Apple for a less expensive price) and am much happier.Every time I see those TV commercials touting this over a MacBook Pro I have to laugh.Note that the price of the Lenovo Yoga is going down every day.  Soon they will be giving them away.  SOOOOOO  Bad.If you buy one of these, you have been warned.
