Poor Hardware and Buggy Software
I've had nothing but problems with this computer since I got it.The included HDD is a complete bottleneck to any sort of performance. Boot time can be measured in minutes. I plan to replace the internal drive.I also made the mistake of trying to update drivers through a normal Windows Update. This has caused numerous problems. The screen will sometimes turn itself off for no apparent reason. The only way to correct the issue is a hard reset. Next, my WiFi adapter disappeared - as in Windows 10 no longer recognizes that it exists at all. I'm working through this problem right now.Table mode is mostly a gimmick at this point. There is only one browser that really supports this mode - Microsoft's Edge browser. Unfortunately, Edge doesn't allow plug-ins. That's a deal breaker for me. I use a 3rd party password manager. On other browsers, the on-screen keyboard is never toggled on when you enter a text box. So tablet mode is restricted to just apps from the store. Not really ideal.
