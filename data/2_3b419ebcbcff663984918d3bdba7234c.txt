Lightweight sexy laptop. Envy of teenagers!
Great laptop computer! Perfect for Real Estate as it so portable and battery life is pretty decent. Charger does get warm but I guess they all do. Started using it right out of the box and found it fairly simple to set up and get going. Wish it came with windows 7 but will upgrade to 10 when the bugs get ironed out. Great one for school or any job requiring carrying it around!! Would buy another in a heartbeat!!
