Careful!!!  Product worked well for 2 months and then display went bad.  I contacted Toshiba and they refused to honor the warrantee.  The product was in perfect condition and never dropped or even scratched.  Their argument was that if the display was not working that it must be my fault as their displays are too good to fail on their own.  So if you are okay with getting a product without a warrantee, go ahead.  For me it was a very sour experience.  I will never work with Toshiba again.
