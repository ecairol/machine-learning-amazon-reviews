It is light weight and looks good. Good Screen (not great) and good keyboard
I am really impressed with this Chromebook. I have never appreciated a buggy and slow Microsoft OS. The Chromebook is the answer if you primarily surf, pay bills, read news, watch videos, etc.  It is light weight and looks good. Good Screen (not great) and good keyboard. Battery life is good.Only three stars because the ASUS Chromebook C300 has no replaceable battery. I would expect this notebook to last for 5 to 7 years but the battery probably will die before then. I do not understand why the battery was designed Not to be replaceable. Another negative is the memory is not expandable but this is probably not an issue to me.I may return the two ASUS Chromebooks I just bought because of the battery issue.  I did not realize the battery was not replaceable.
