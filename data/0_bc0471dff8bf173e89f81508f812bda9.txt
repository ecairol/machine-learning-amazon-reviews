mostly not good
Not loading websites. Ping works fine so it's a software issue. There's a lot of bloatware on this laptop from asus and I've never trusted or liked mckafee antivirus programs but it's here on a trial. Don't like the way win 8 looks and it's kinda hard to use. I'm already doing a wipe and reinstall to fix the Internet access problem. Hope it works.
