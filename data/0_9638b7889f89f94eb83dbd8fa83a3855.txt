I loved it - 5 stars
For the ~6 weeks I owned and operated this computer, I loved it - 5 stars, easily. The only (minor) complaints would be less-than-stellar screen resolution and, as my other reviews around the internet have pointed out, this thing does attract fingerprints. But for the price, this laptop cannot be beat.Having said that, mine developed something of a battery flaw and would not work unless it was plugged into the wall. I treat my electronics very well, and was surprised to have this thing conk out on me after only 1.5 months of ownership.So far, I've been able to find two instances of this battery malfunction online. It's a very isolated case, but it did happen to me which was a huge bummer.
