Hisense has no sense (of customers)
Do yourself 2 favors:1. Never use anything Hisense. They're not interested in you, just giving you crap hardware and having your money.2. Get a chromecast.I got a hisense (first foray into GTV) and it was fine at first. But the remote sucked, and the battery life of the remote sucked. So I got rechargable batteries. Easy fix. But then the remote was still difficult, web browsing was difficult, and streaming things became more difficult. When Jellybean came out, Hisense's lack of sense (e.g. responding to customers) made point #1 clear. There's no reason to use that company. Maybe give this as a gift to someone you hate? You cant root it, you cant update it, and most things you do with an android OS you cant do with this piece of trash. If you buy this, buy a garbage bag too, so that you can go ahead and throw it in the bag. At least then one of the things you bought would be useful.
