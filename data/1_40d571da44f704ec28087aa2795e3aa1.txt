Not a Chromebook fan.
For the price, you can't complain, but I wish I had paid a bit more for one with Windows.  Chrome books seem to have no function, other than get online, and use a few useless apps.  You can't type, you can't download anything, and you can't hook up any devices to it, but you can sure surf the internet.  Definitely do your research before purchasing.
