ASUS 15-inch X551
This computer crashed in 6 months. Turned it on one morning and it went into a 'Diagnosing PC' loop. Tried to reboot it numerous times during the week with no luck. Had PC diagnosed by an IT professional. He stated the motherboard was toast and this was fairly common with this particular model.  If considering I would suggest you look at a better computer.This is the first product that I have purchased through Amazon since 2002 that I have had an issue with.
