So far, So good
Bought one of these from a lady at work who had only had it for 2months because her mother did not like computers.  I paid $140 so I figured I cant go wrong.  I like it very much.  Mine does not have a DVD drive, not sure if this one does.  Also, it does not have Bluetooth.  It came with Windows 8.1 but it updated to Windows 10 yesterday/  Not sure about how it stacks up against other machines for $250 but it is great for $140.It does take a while to get initialized and updated, especially to Windows 10>  I would recommend that you just leave it alone and let it update before you try to do too much.  Windows 10 does seem to have a lot of stuff going on in the background because the mouse  pointer continually shows the hour glass for a second and then a second later.  Annoying.
