Wasnt what i Expected
its just my personal opinion and wasn't aware that a chrome book was just a giant cell phone with a physical keyboard so i returned it as quickly as it arrived to me. i did however like the look and feel of it, very slimming and texture was smooth, i just didn't like the fact that all you can do is use apps and i don't want laptop that has the same capabilities as my Galaxy S5.
