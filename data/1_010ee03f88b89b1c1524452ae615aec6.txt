Will never purchase another chromebook. This is the solution!
This tiny, shiny, dayglo mini laptop is worth every penny. As other reviwers have said, it comes with a lot of crappy apps and bloatware which is commonplace for Windows laptops. Easy fix? Download CCleaner and PC Decrapifier (honestly what it's called). CCleaner will clean up all the unused empty space you have created from removing all the useless programs and apps and the decrapifier will remove those apps for you if you are not versed in what bloatware looks like. Anywhoo, after doing all that and removing apps (search remove apps and it will pop up the page where you go to uninstall apps). I do this, and remove the apps from the start menu. This way, it runs more like Windows 7.I bought this laptop as my primary work machine. I am a telecommute administrator. My needs are few. I need an AIM based chat client and a SIP server phone agent to be able to work, and they need to run simultaneously. This machine does that beautifully. I use a wireless headset and wireless numberpad. No lag issues, no choppy phone calls. Clear sound on my end and theirs. This is something I wasn't getting with a brand new ASUS.I believe this little bargain laptop is totally worth the money. No, you are not going to be able to run Steam on it with any sort of quality for gaming. No, Diablo III nor Minecraft will run on it well. However, for working, school stuff, browsing, streaming.. It is a perfect budget friendly machine to do what needs to be done. If you need more, buy more. I feel that this machine alone renders the chromebook obsolete. I sold my chromebook when I purchased this because it had rendered it pretty much useless.This is a solid, well built and steady laptop. The horizon blue is a little cartoony, but I have warmed up to it. Included photo of work setup.
