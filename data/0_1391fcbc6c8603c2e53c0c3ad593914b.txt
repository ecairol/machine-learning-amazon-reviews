Beware of what Ipad you are really getting
The Ad says "Ipad Air with plastic,no box'' Here's what you will get: It comes in a 9 inch cubical cardboard box-The Ipad still has the sealed cloth bag around it and is wrapped in bubble wrap. There are 3 little air pillows around it. That is ALL YOU GET, period. I never even opened up the cloth bag to look at the actual Ipad so I will assume that the "with plastic" means there is the thin plastic screen protector, in place. I will never know because I didn't open the cloth bag. Its true that there is ''no box'' but there will also be no instruction booklet, no USB cable, and no charger. (seller later told me he would send these accessories, which normally come with a "New" Ipad air-.One can merely speculate what happened to the originals. I had  assumed from the original Ad that the only thing that would be missing was the original box. Also, I was a little surprised when an email from the seller said "iPad its brand New, it cover under apple's limited warranty.Model Verizon - put a sim card and use anywhere"---thats a cut and paste.......The surprises just kept on coming. It went back in the original box, back to Amazon and out of my life.
