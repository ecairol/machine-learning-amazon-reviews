Disappointingly smudgy plastics mar what is otherwise a great Chromebook.
The C300 offers a not few things to distinguish it from the other 13 inch Chromebooks currently on the market:- Low glare matte finish screen- Tiny one piece power adapter, easily the best vs. two piece Samsung & Toshiba adapters- Excellent 10+ hour battery life with fanless design and real use performance I couldn't distinguish from the faster Intel Celeron in my Toshiba- Low priceUnfortunately both the attractively bamboo-grained top lid and keyboard deck and touchpad are total magnets for natural oils in your hands (even food-free ones). The current Toshiba Chromebook is phenomenal in this regard - it shows no fingerprints whatsoever, it may look cheap to some eyes but on function, they've done a great job. Asus can do better, I know - I owned a few of their netbooks and they know how to make a matte casing that doesn't show finger oils. I returned it.
