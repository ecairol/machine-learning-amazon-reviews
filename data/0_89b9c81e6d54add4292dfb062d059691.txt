DON'T BUY IT UNLESS YOU HAVE A TON OF TIME AND MONEY TO WASTE!
The laptop functions fairly well as advertised but is extremely flimsy.  Think:  made of rubber.  Extreme care must be taken to ensure the hard drive in particular isn't damaged during regular handling.  This thing just feels cheap.  THE ONLINE SUPPORT SITE FOR DRIVERS AND UPDATES IS COMPLETELY USELESS.  It's almost impossible to find useful device drivers there without conducting EXTENSIVE prior research.  Don't even bother calling the support number.  You will get some witless Philipino twit who wants to charge you a tech fee just to tell you he doesn't have a clue.Yes it's a decent laptop, but if you carry it around, it WILL break.  Only purchase this laptop if you really know how to fix PCs and laptops, or you like wasting time and lots of money on external tech support!
