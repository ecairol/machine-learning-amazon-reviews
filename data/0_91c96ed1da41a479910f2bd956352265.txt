The Slow CPU Is The Problem
I get it that there are some elderly folks who this laptop will be just fine for, but only because they don't know any better.  Why not get your loved one a machine that actually performs well (for around the same money)?  They'll have an even better experience.All computers benefit from bloatware removal, but doing so won't fix this laptop's laggy performance.  The ONLY problem with this laptop is the super slow AMD E1-6010.  Please do yourself a favor and look up how this processor compares on Notebookcheck, Cpubenchmark, and CPU Boss.I bought a B50-45 laptop brand new for $169.99 shipped.  That's the only reason I bought it.  I did everything possible to make it work better.  I stopped all unnecessary services, I did a clean install to Windows 10 and removed "all" bloatware.  It didn't matter.  Programs take a long time to open, websites are very slow to load and extremely laggy when scrolling, videos are frequently choppy, etc.  There are several versions of this B50-45 being sold on Amazon.  Read the other reviews.If you want decent performance in a budget laptop find one with the AMD A8-6410 or an Intel i3 processor.  You can frequently find a laptop with the  A8-6410 for the same price as this Lenovo B50.  I hadn't used an AMD processor for 15 years, and after my recent experience owning the B50 with the E1-6010, I was ready to give up on AMD.  The performance was so bad I got rid of the B50 and started a new search.I found several comments on computer deal websites about the AMD A8-6410 being as good as an Intel i3.  I found a laptop with the A8-6410 for the same price I paid for the B50 (well, $10 more), so I took a chance.  It's night and day, the A8-6410 is much, much better.  You still have to get rid of the OEM bloatware.  The easiest way (thanks to Microsoft) is to upgrade to Windows 10.  During the upgrade it will ask you what "Apps" you would like to keep, select "Keep Nothing" and all bloatware will be gone.  You can get A8-6410's and i3 laptops all the time for $275 to $300.  You'll be glad you did.
