It's terrible.
I thought I was getting quality when purchasing this. The trackpad is a big problem, it makes the laptop impossible to use and very frustrating. Mine may just be faulty, although I saw other reviews that have my same problem. 'What kind of laptop doesn't zoom in and out with its trackpad? C'mon Dell, it's 2015. It's terrible.
