Meh
I needed a laptop for school because I'm trying not to fail my senior year of high school because of not having tech. I wanted something Simple so could share documents with my teacher and fulfill my basic YouTube needs. The main strength of the product is that is is simple and can handle pretty much of your basic task when it comes to school work although it doesn't have word if that is what you are looking for. However there is a lot that it is lacking, it's internal memory is horrid and the chrome OS isn't the best out there. Basically if you wan't something borderline simple this is a product for you.
