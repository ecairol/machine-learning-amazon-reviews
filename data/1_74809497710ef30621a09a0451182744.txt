Good Bang For Your Buck
It is true it comes out of the box with a lot of bloatware, but that's a simple problem to take care of.  I bought this for $250, went and bought a 250GB SSD for $90, swapped it out, reinstalled the OS and it works great.  I only needed this computer strictly for my company for spreadsheets, PDF, Quickbooks, etc. and for that purpose this is probably the best bang for your buck.  For $350, I have a computer that boots up from the time you hit the button to signed in about 15-20 seconds.  Can't beat it.
