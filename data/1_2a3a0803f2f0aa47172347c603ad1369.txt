In comparison to the logitec revue, it's faster but buggier.
I bought this to put in another room and i already own a logitec revue.  The revue was fine, but it had it's share of bugs and i would have to restart it occasionally, but for the most part it worked well.  It was just older and i had a desire for a faster processor.  While the hisense pulse delivers in processing speed and i have no desire for any more speed, it has the worst wifi signal strength of any device i own or ever owned.  This is due to poor design or lack thereof.  I think they just simply put an antenna on the board and soldered it into the wifi chip, didn't put any thought into it at all.  Realistically you may be able to go through 1 wall and 20 feet, that's it.  Anything more and forget about it, it may show 1-2 bars of signal and connect, but the unit either won't have internet, or constantly drops the wifi connection.  I think they only ever tested it in a 1 room lab setting before putting it into production  Also, the unit get very very hot after 1 movie or partway into a long movie.  It then starts to give you screen artifacts.  You have to shut it off and let it cool down, when you touch the unit, it's really hot, i imagine long term reliability will suffer once the solder starts to go brittle in some areas because of all the overheating and cooling cycles.Pros:Fast Processor, plenty of performance.Cons:Horrible wifi strength, all of my phones, PS3, XBOX360, Samsung smart TV etc........ Have no trouble with connection.  This thing does.Overheats when used alot.Remote must be level to operate either side.Conclusion:  This unit works fine for now, but when it dies i'll replace it with something designed better.
