Refurbished Asus X205TA 11.6 meets my need
Put more than a few hours into tweeking the refurbished Asus X205TA to personalize it and am quite pleased.  Refurbisher seems to have done a good job.  Just be advised that microsoft's present offer for free upgrade to W 10 for all buyers of products purchased with W 8.1 (not mentioned in product discription), as reviewers have mentioned elsewhere, did not work ...and trying to do anything with microsoft and all it's bloatware on here was an utter pain in the neck.  Pin that fault on microsoft.  The only actual negative, which for me was actually a positive,  in this refurbished offer was that the color advertised was blue but the one received was black.  While I really like the black far better, someone wanting and expecting blue might be disappointed.  Read reviews for a new one carefully.  Well worth the money  if you just want to browse the net and bookmarks you have on your desktop, and work google docs (A Firefox user, I didn't try to run IE, and downloaded W Classic View to replace W 8.1 view  ...Classic View apparently harks back to XP which I run on my desktops).  Nice and light to carry.
