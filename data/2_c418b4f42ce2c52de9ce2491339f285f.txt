Way better than the Co-Star
I returned a Co-Star to get this unit and couldn't be happier.It has a very fast interface, much nicer remote and the "Discover" functionality is amazing.I look forward to Google releasing the next version of Google TV so that the microphone built into the remote will allow me voice control.This remote is nice and slim with a much better key layout.This is the best of the Google TV devices so far.
