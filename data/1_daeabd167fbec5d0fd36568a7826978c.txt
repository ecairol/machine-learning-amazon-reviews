Great price for the components (even the screen)
Pros: Great price for the components (even the screen). Smooth, strong, fast, bearable screen, backlit keyboard, nice sleek design.Cons: Track pad is one of the worst I've ever used, at first it's hard to even slide your fingers across the rigid track pad... now it is seriously delayed and moves randomly. So if you were to buy this laptop, get a usb/wireless mouse. What I assume to be the ethernet port, doesn't work... even with a usb - ethernet connection, I guess this laptop doesn't have the drivers to support it? Other than the really annoying cons, it is a decent laptop for its sleek slim design, backlit keyboard, gpu, cpu, ram, ssd, and price.
