SOLID COMPUTER
COMPUTER: Its probably the best computer on the market. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that the screen resulution is not wonderful, dont get me wrong, it is fabulous for the price, but dont expect it to look super high res. Also I wish the volume was louder - we dont watch TV on it or anything , but when watching youtube videos, it the volume at MAX is still very low. But this isnt a prob if you use earphones.Chrome: They do have some limitations, which for the normal person are no issue. But make sure you are aware of them prior to getting a chrome book. You will have issues printing unless you have a wireless printer. Also you will be saving most things online, because there is not a ton of hard drive space. Enough to get by - like 16 gigs, but mass amounts of video or pictures will need to go on the drive or someother cloud. Also, you cannot load programs  - so if you need a program that is not owned by google - this isnt for you.Stregths: Web browsing, email, anything online, stellar battery life, light and portable, charger is very petite (no lugging around a huge charger) start up and shut down is fast, no need to purchase virus protection, way better interface than Windows 8, easy for everyone to use. From box, you enter your google email, and you are DONE. The only thing you may want to do is change the picture on the screen, other than that, no fuss.
