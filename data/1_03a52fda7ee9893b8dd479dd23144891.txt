I like the 11.6 inch better
I like the 11.6 inch version of this better.  The smaller version is a glossy screen, which normally I would prefer matte.  However, the glossy is better in this case because everything looks more vibrant and clearer.  This 13.3 inch is matte but it just doesn't look very good.  The smaller version is also silver and looks more high-end like a mac.
