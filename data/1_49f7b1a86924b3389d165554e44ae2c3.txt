Absolutely love my new Zenbook
Absolutely love my new Zenbook! It's not the most powerful computer available but it was never meant to be. It runs the entire Office suite without any issues and the battery lasts 8-10+ hrs depending on what I'm working on. On top of that, this thing is practically a feather. Great notebook for anyone who is on the go and needs a lightweight machine that will last most of the day.
