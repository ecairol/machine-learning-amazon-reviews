Bad
Not a good product.  Impossible to get working with my TV, will not sync at the right resolution, so it's useless.  Waited too long, thinking the firmware update would surely address something so fundamental.  Big mistake.  Now it's too late to return and I'm left with a useless device and wasted time.I got the Google TV because it's "open" as opposed to my Apple TV which cannot do Amazon Live streaming or any of the other many apps available here.  Google TV is much more complex to work with.  The contol is an odd mix of mouse pointer, arrow keys, and full keyboard on the remote.  But, the sophistication stops short of being useful.  I cannot get into the device and override the poor video detection.If the video output actually worked, it would go up to a 2 star rating.  Maybe up to 3 if I found some good applications for it.  But, even in the best case, it seems like a clunky interface with questionable usability.  The Apple TV is far superior.  If Apple ever opened up their apps to the Apple TV, there would be no comparison.
