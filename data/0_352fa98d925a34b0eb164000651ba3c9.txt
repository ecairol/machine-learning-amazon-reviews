like use the Internet and check my email
I bought this eight months ago. It worked to write my thesis proposal on and do regular daily things, like use the Internet and check my email. The "F" key is now sticking, which is usually the kiss of death with my laptops. Trying to clean it will mean keys that fall off and won't stay back on. It runs games like computers ran back in the early '90s. You can get up and make a sandwich while you're waiting for it to load. If you could use Netscape and some Geocities pages, this laptop would be great.Oh and it doesn't stay charged anymore so I have to leave it plugged in all the time. Awesome.I'll go back to doing things in longhand on a piece of paper. It would save time at this point.
