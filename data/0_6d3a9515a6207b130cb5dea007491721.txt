BUYERS BEWARE!!!
I ordered a "brand new ipad" and it seems like they are repackaging old units and selling them. The box was wrapped with plastic and everything looked brand new, accept for when you turn the box over. There was no imei number listed and the serial number was not valid. I spoke with  several people at apple and they told me that this is a fraudulent product. Think twice before you purchase off of amazon. Refund is on the way
