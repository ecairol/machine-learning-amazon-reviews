Great device, fast boot up
Great device, fast boot up, easy to use, and has most features that someone would need on a daily basis. Highly recommended for anyone needing a basic word processing and web browsing laptop.However, there is no Java capabilities, and very few programs have a Chrome OS supported format. Just a warning for those who like add-ons.
