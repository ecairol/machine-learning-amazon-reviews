Amazon not very helpful
course it broke after 35 days and we have topay to have it returned to ASUS, and wait 3+ weeks for a repair or replacement.Now I have to buy a new unit so my Son doesn't fall 3 weeks behind. This policy will make me think about my next purchase. The next one will not be from amazon.
