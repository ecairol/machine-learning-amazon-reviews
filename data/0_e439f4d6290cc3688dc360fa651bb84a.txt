PLEASE READ IF YOU'RE CONNECTING TO A HOME NETWORK FOR STREAMING!
I purchased this after seeing so many rave reviews and finding it to be one of the only 1080p smart TVs in this size. I ran set up, quick and easy. I was able to stream 1 movie on WI-FI flawlessly before the trouble began. Literally 2 hrs after opening the box it was unresponsive to the remote. I thought maybe the batteries in the remote were dead so changed them. Still nothing. I tried using the manual power button on the back of the TV, still unresponsive. I unplugged for an hour, came back and tried to use the TV again, still unresponsive after turning it on. At that point I read the 1-2 star reviews of this product to find multiple reviews describing Vizio's known ongoing issue with it's network connectivity. This TV will malfunction if connected to a network that allows file sharing. GOOGLE IT. It's all over the web. Basically, this has to be a stand alone on your network or turn off file sharing which makes all the other devices on a network useless for what "A Network" was designed for. FYI the problem exists even when hooked up with an ethernet cable. This is going back today.
