Fantastic Ipad
I recommend this Ipad to all who were just like me.  I had the very first Ipad.  Oh my gosh, what a difference!  As I lay them side to side I cannot believe I held onto my old one for so long!  The new features and pictures and sound are more enriched for eyes and ears to enjoy!  It is so light and thin!  I have not been more happy with any item in past two years as I am with this Ipad!  It is more than worth the price!  It only needs a USB port and it would be perfect!
