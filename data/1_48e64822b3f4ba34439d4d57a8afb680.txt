Nice unit but probably has a design defect, and beware ASUS's abysmal support
I bought this for my 7th-grade son's schoolwork, as it's a long-battery-life, low-heat, no-moving-parts device that's great for his backpack overladen with huge three-ring binders. So far, it's working out great. It's extremely well suited to school work, especially in school systems that rely on Google Docs (which ours does).It's an elegant little device, and it performs really well. My only quibble with it is that the trackpad is a bit cheap in comparison to the super-high-quality trackpad on the Macbook lines -- but this is a $200 computer, so I'm not exactly scandalized.REVISED, Oct 2015:I have to downgrade my rating on this unit from five stars to three. I still think that it's not a bad computer, but it has what appears to be a moderate design defect, compounded by the fact that ASUS's customer service and tech support are abysmal. Two weeks into its use the screen started to get seriously abraded from contact with the keyboard when the unit is closed. I managed to RMA the unit, and nearly three weeks after I shipped it out am still waiting for news (to be fair, one of those weeks was consumed with shipping time across the country). But I fear that they'll just replace the screen or screen cover with the same material that will degrade when coming in contact with the keyboard.
