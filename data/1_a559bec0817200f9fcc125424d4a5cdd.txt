very pleased
I got this laptop from walmart because it was only $245.00 and I think it's great! I like to play N64 games on my laptops and this laptop does great with playing them without lag or glitch. I am new to Windows 8 so I'm still getting used to it but so far its been pretty user friendly and easy to get used to, and I would recommend this to anyone. As to the people saying it's cheaply made: well go buy something more expensive, if the price is cheap, odds are it is cheaply made. I wouldn't spend 300 on materials to build something and sell it for 200, for 250, this is a damn good laptop.
