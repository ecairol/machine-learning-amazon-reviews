Regret
This device seemed to have come with a virus or something.  Windows keep popping up as soon as I got it all set up. I'm not happy with apps, sound, settings And versatility of playing movies etc.. Missing players for certain applications. It's not entirely user friendly either. Should have gone with a Laptop or Apple.  Regretting my purchase thus far.
