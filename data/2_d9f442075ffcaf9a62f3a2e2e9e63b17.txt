So "Smart", it forgot how to TV
This TV worked great, for 2 days. Then it just started freezing after you start it and try to execute any menu commands. I called customer service (Vizio) and the troubleshooting steps verified that it was defective. No repairs or replacement options are available for this model, so they've told me I have to send them pictures proving the TV freezes (aren't all pictures frozen?) along with proof of purchase and they'll let me know what's next. I'll update the post once I learn more.My primary mistake: I tossed the box to the TV after a couple of days of it working. If I hadn't, maybe I could have just returned it through the more friendly Amazon method :(**Update: After awaiting a promised call from Vizio that never came, i contacted them and they instructed me to mail them the TV back for a refund . No prepaid shipping or anything. I decided to call Amazon and they were brilliant. Replaced the TV and provided return labels for the busted one!My replacement hasn't had any issues. I suspect that my original froze when I connected it to my PC via the Plex app to use it as a media server. I didn't set that up on my  replacement TV and haven't had any issues. That may not have been the cause, but I thought I'd share in case it helps anyone.**12/2015 UPDATE**So far, no issues with the replacement TV. I watch Hulu, Netflix, Amazon VOD, Crackle and even movies off of my USB drive (MP4 format) and haven't had any issues. Bumped the rating up to 4 stars now. Still can't give 5 because of the poor customer support from Vizio.
