YMMV
Bought this and returned after a few hours fooling with it. I found the keyboard and trackpad difficult to use. Part of the problem is that the machine is just too light and so shakes slightly on typing if you keep it on your lap, build quality is only B. Screen is good quality but not very bright and I find the wide aspect ratio awkward in a 13". Music was OK through the speakers (Although they're aren't very powerful) but very quiet over good quality headphones. Machine starts up very quickly and runs well. Nice machine for the price but not what I was looking for.
