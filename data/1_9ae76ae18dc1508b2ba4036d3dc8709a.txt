It's a decent Budget laptop.
This Budget laptop is actually handling way better than what I thought it was going to. I love gaming, but this isn't a laptop that is designed for gaming. There's no problem browsing around with Google Chrome and it handles multiple tabs just fine. It can handle some games such as Minecraft, Garry's Mod, Blockade 3D and Terraria smoothly only if you drop all the graphics to low settings. Again this laptop isn't meant for gaming.  If I would recommend this laptop for anyone, it would be to people that are into browsing the internet, or just need a laptop for school that can handle minor tasks. Overall it's fine.*Warning* Be prepared to update this laptop once you get it. If I remember correctly there are 30+ updates, not large files, but it will take some time. I had no problem after the updates.
