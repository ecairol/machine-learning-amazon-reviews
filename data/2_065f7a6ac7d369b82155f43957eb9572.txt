Perfect for my purposes.
I've looked long and hard for a lightweight powerful laptop that I could afford.  This is it.  I wasn't familiar with the M-Core processor but a little research indicated that seems to be close to the same power class as the Core i5, and that has proven to be true in my experience.  I run professional recording software on this machine (though I don't do any complicated work).  It also works with my Hauppauge USB TV tuner and it actually works in that regard than my 5.5 pound Core i-3 laptop.  It runs exceptionally cool, as well. 2.5 pounds, Supposedly up to 10 hours of battery power, but I haven't tested that capacity. The 256 Gb SSD, very quick, and if I run short of storage, I just go to my USB -3 external drive, or to Dropbox.  3 USB-3 connections.  It also has an HDMI out, but I have not yet tried that.  I love the anodized aluminum case, but I do have to say it is very prone to fingerprinting.  For what I do, it is a great machine.
