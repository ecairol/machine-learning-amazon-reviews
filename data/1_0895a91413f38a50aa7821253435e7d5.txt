GREAT basic computer for the money
GREAT basic computer.  My wife and I got these about a year ago and both are still running strong.  There's not much extra but the 4gb of ram and 500 gb hd are what we really needed.  It could use more USB ports and blue tooth.  However, we paid $250 each for these and really wanted something with good quality to carry around for cheap.  My wife kept the Winblows 8.1 and I dumped everything and put the newest Linux Mint and a backup of the newest puppy linux (puppy btw has issues with the mouse and wifi).  It's been good for what it is and well worth the money.  You can tell it's got some hallow space in the case but the plastic is not flimsy feeling.  The only cheap feeling part is the touchpad mouse.  It frankly sucks and feels cheap.  I use a USB wireless mouse anyway but it would be nice if the mouse was nicer.  So, if you want a basic decent computer to do day to day browsing and computing, it's great...don't expect extras though and don't expect it to compare with a MAC, especially for $250.
