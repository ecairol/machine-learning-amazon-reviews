Worst Tablet
Awful I purchased this tablet in 2014 and 3 months later if that had to send it back because it wouldn't power up.  They had to replace it.  Here it is months later and same thing.  I don't even use it that often and now my warranty has expired.  It's not worth buying an extended warranty.
