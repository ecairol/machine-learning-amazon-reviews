Best $500 2 in 1 Laptop/Tablet on the Market
Pros: Windows 8.1 64bit; 4 GB Memory; 500 GB Hard Drive; 720p Display; micro HDMI output; solid craftsmanship/feel; 7 hour battery life; HD video camera; extremely convinient display modes (laptop/tablet/tent/stand)Cons: Small keyboard; no Ethernet port; Too heavy to hold like a book for long periods of time; GPU cannot handle modern gamesThis computer has been great for Microsoft Office, Adobe Acrobat, light Photoshop, web surfing, Skyping, and streaming 1080p videos through the HDMI output. Unfortunately the GPU cannot handle modern games such as Skyrim and Assassin's Creed Black Flag.The battery on my laptop broke after the first 3 weeks of use. Luckely it was still under warenty. Lenovo took 6 days to resolve the problem. It might be a good idea to buy the extended warrenty.My Yoga 2 11 works great. I highly recommend in the $500 price range.
