A Transcendent Tablet - Apple Delivers This Time
The iPad Air is, without exception, the best piece of technology that I have owned, and I have owned nice tablets and computers before.  One of the first things that jumps out about this device, beyond the gorgeous display and excellent speed, is the long lasting battery life.  I have owned this tablet since the day it came out, and I am still averaging about 10 hours of battery life on it.  That is a good thing, too, because if one gets this tablet, they will be using it a lot.  That is, by and large, due to the tremendous versatility that the iPad Air provides it users with.  I have effectively utilized this tablet at both work and in my graduate courses, and by my judgement, my performance has seen a boost by consequence of that.With that in mind, it must be acknowledged that the iPad Air, or more generally, apple products are more expensive.  Critics of the iPad often point to that very fact, but a "premium" price boost to a top of the line product is not unique to the iPad - the nicest things are also invariably the most expensive things.  Because this tablet is so well made, there will typically be very little to no frustration associated with it.  It gets the job done across the board, be it for personal or professional use.  It is for that reason that the iPad Air is worth the extra $100-300. As a graduate student, I cringed at my bank account after I purchased this, but at this point, I'm honestly relieved that I got the iPad.  $600 may seem like a lot at first, but by the time a month has gone by, and one realizes how much they actually use this thing, that $600 will start to seem like a small price to pay.  Once a former galaxy tablet loyalist - now firmly in the iPads corner.  Truly, this is such a well made device - it really doesn't get better than the iPad Air right now, and it probably won't until the next IPAs either.
