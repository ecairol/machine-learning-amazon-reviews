My son is a devoted MacBook Pro fan, but even he had to admit this comes pretty darned close.
Great notebook, great keyboard for writers, and fantasticl screen without the glare. Windows 10 easy to install, everything worked out of the box. It's super light, super intuitive, and my new best friend. Shipped without problems, and had to laugh at the extra care with which it was packed.
