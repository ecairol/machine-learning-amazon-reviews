Very good laptop. Though touch pad could have been better implemented. Major drawback is a lack of keyboard backlighting. I think UX305 definitely worth its price. You won't be able to find such a nice looking, lightweight laptop with Full HD display from any other manufacturer for 650 USD. Device feels reliable as well.
