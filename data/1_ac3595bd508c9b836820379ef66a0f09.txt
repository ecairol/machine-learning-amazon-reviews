It's very light and doesn't get hot so it's comfortable to use in that regard
It's a cheap laptop.  It gets the job done.  I was looking for something with a low price tag to use every now and then for internet and writing.  Functionally, this laptop will do that.  It's very light and doesn't get hot so it's comfortable to use in that regard. The keyboard and touchpad are not the most usable in the world though.  The pointer moves when you click the buttons on the touchpad and the buttons are hard to click.  The keys on the keyboard have space between them making it a little tougher to find the right keys with touch typing.  The whole top of the laptop vibrates just a wee bit when you press the keys, giving the whole top a bit of a flimsy feel.  The pointer moving when I click was so annoying within the first few minutes that I decided to sell it and get a different one.
