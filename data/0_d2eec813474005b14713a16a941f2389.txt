Garbage
Do not buy this laptop. I have had wifi connection and audio issues since day 1 and I got the laptop a month ago. I've had to open three tickets with Dell tech support, and since I made that first call they have made the problemmuch worse. Now I can't get online AT ALL since they messed with it. This laptop is a huge waste of money and time considering the hours you log with Dell tech support for them to only make things worse.
