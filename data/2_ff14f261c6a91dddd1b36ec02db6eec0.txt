great for school!
Got this for college and it works really well! the keyboard takes a little while to get used to, but it's not uncomfortable. Writing essays on this shouldn't be a problem. The sound is great! Wish it could be a little louder, but hey what more do you expect for an 11.6 inch laptop? This laptop is so compact and light. I love it! Great for college students!
