It's Pretty Cool
I'm a fan of the smaller laptops. The fact is, you can spend just about as much as you want to on one of those. It's nice that you don't have to. This ASUS model has a lot to like, even if it's missing a couple things.WHAT IT HAS:- Windows 10 - Awesome. It's by far the bet operating system developed by Microsoft thus far. it's nice that this model comes equipped with it.- 8GB RAM - Keeps things moving.- i5 Intel Processor - It would be nice if it were the i6 or i7 but this is not the latest model made by ASUS.- 802.11ac - extremely fast WIFI capabilities.WHAT IT'S MISSING- Touchscreen - although it's not priced like some touch screen laptops on the market today, it's missing other things that would have made it okay to add it on.- Backlit keyboard- 10 key number pad- Carry SleeveWhile the pros outnumber the cons, there are a lot of choices out there. Personally, I like this laptop and I am using it every day. It has all that I need, even if there are a couple things that would have made it really cool. It's still pretty cool.
