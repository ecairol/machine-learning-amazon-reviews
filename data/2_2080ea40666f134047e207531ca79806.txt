Great Product
I recently purchased the Asus zenbook UX305LA.  This really is about the best laptop value I have ever seen.  What makes this laptop so great is that offers the best attributes that you want in a laptop without many sacrifices:  1) it is very fast with its i5 processor and 8G of ram, 2) it is very lightweight and portable, 3) it is well-built and does not feel cheap at all, 4) the speakers are great and loud, 5) it has very long battery life of near 10 hours, 6) the price is very reasonable with similar products costing $300 to $500 more (ie. Surface 3 pro, Mac book air, and Dell XPS).  The only thing you sacrifice with this laptop is that you can't play the top notch games on the market as it does not have a dedicated graphics card.  However, if you are a casual gamer, this laptop has plenty of ability to play games.  I downloaded GTA San Andreas from the app store and it runs beautifully.I strongly recommend this laptop as it has everything you need in a laptop at a great price without any real drawbacks.
