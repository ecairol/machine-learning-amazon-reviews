A great ultrabook, but NOT WINDOWS 8.1!!!
I'm in between 4 and 5 stars, so I'll round up. My only real complaint, which is more of a warning is that this computer comes running Windows 10, not 8.1 as it is in the description!! It says free upgrade, so I took that to mean it would be an option to upgrade later, or at the very least, would let me revert to 8.1, which it doesn't! I have a work program that I thought needed 8.1, but it turns out it will allow 10 now, so it's not a problem, but if you need Windows 8.1, do not get this laptop.With that said, this is a beautiful machine. It is almost impossibly thin and light. Seriously, I'm not sure how something this powerful is running in this package. I love the dark gray color with the pretty swirly brushed look on the outside. The matte screen is so comforting to my eyes which are used to a horrible glare from my previous glossy laptop screen. The mousepad is a little loose feeling and noisy, but I got used to it easily. I might find myself missing the numeric keypad, but there's no way to fit it without shrinking down the keyboard too much. I haven't had it long enough to assess the battery life, but the start up from sleep mode is very quick just like it says.
