Awesome much better than Vizio and Logitech
I'm very pleased with this device.  After owning Logitech and Vizio co-star this device is definitely an improvement.  I did not like using a keyboard with the Logitech, and the Vizio, even though it has a similar remote to the Pulse, the keys are very tiny and cramped together.  The Pulse's remote on the other hand it's very comfortable to use.  They could have done a better job in the positioning of the keys, like placing the play, fast forward buttons in the middle of the remote instead  of all the way at the bottom (the Vizio has them all the way at the top which is not good either).Being able to use the slingbox app was a must for me so that eliminated me buying the Roku or Apple tv.  I was not able to use the slingbox app in the Logitech.  It worked with the Vizio, but it does not offers you as good control of the device as the Pulse.  The Pulse on screen remote keys offer you more choices and stay on as long as you need them.  The picture quality is fantastic.  It's hard to tell the difference between live tv and the remote viewing.The Logitech device died on me after a year and the Vizio had to be returned because it kept freezing.I would have given the Pulse 5 stars, but I do not like using the ir blaster.  With the Vizio I was able to control all devices without the need of the blaster.
