Close, but not amazing
This is a good computer, but a few details keep it from being great.1. Fit, finishes and materials are all nice, and I like the color (I am male and work in an office FWIW, I think I don't look bad carrying this computer). It is dead silent and light. It feels fast and responsive compared to a late 2013 Macbook Air doing office and the web. I also like the compact AC adapter and the fact that they included a wired network adapter.2. Asus' graphic design is awful. Its horrible logos and the bad typography they use on the keyboard spoil an otherwise beautiful design.3. It comes with little adware (and I didn't buy the Microsoft store version). On the software front, it's worse offenders are actually Asus' utilities that nag you constantly to click a button to update something or to agree on something. I uninstalled most of them.4. The touchpad is not nearly as loud as I was expecting, but mutitouch gestures are unreliable and the second clic area is just nonsensical. My 150 dollar chormebook has a much more responsive and usable touchpad.5. The keyboard is not backlit. I would have paid for this feature but I knew what I was buying. UPDATE: after a few days I can say the keyboard is very nice to type on.6. The screen has notorious backlight bleeding, although it's noticeable only when the screen is very dark (for example, when the computer is booting up). This, together with the off calibration and the slight but noticeable flex in the lid, give you a clear idea of the price of this computer.To sum up: it is a nice and competent computer, and good value for the money.UPDATE: I get 6,5 hs of battery life at most, just doing chrome. That's pretty far from the promised 10 hs.UPDATE 2: Somehow the computer now has around 8 - 9 hours of battery life, which is much nicer. Apparently it needed a couple of recharge cycles to calibrate correctly. I'm adding one star because of this and the fact that Asus support commented this review.
