Asus OK, Microsoft NOT
The computer is ok, but the keyboard a bit tinny for the money. The software -- Microsoft Windows 8.1 -- is a disaster. Despite attempts to fix the problem with the help of Asus tech support, it just wouldn't consistently connect to the internet. Talking to Microsoft tech support is a joke. Even though this was a new computer, they wanted additional $$ to diagnose the problem caused by THEIR software. Although the computer itself was ok, dealing with Microsoft made me return the computer.
