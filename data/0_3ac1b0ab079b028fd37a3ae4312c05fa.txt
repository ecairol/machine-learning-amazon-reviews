Barely  enough horse power to even web browse, and the warranty was started  4 months ago!!!
UPDATE 11/15/15I went to the Linovo support page, DL'ed a utility that let them see my serial number and GUESS WHAT?This laptop that I received on  11/14/15 is only warrantied until In Warranty, expires 2016-07-09  (see the screen shot)It looks to me as if someone started the warranty on this machine way back in July!!! WTF is going on?I did manage to recover my windows 7 install key with a  utility called Produkey that unencrypts it from the registry.Now I need to either get someone to send me media or dig out  a copy of generic windows 7 that I have stashed  somewhere.(I should not have to be doing ANY of this!!)UPDATE 11/14/15The model number on this machine is Lenovo B50-45.  I don't know why the heck they try to hide this info in a lot of computer adds.Anyway this machine has turned out to be too slow even to do decent web browsing. This is just about the slowest processor that can be bought, (the E1-6010 dual core) and I am not sure how much an 8GB or even a 16GB upgrade of the memory would help.( see crucial dot com for memory)I am seriously thinking of sending it back due to it's abysmally poor performance, and the lack of Windows 7 media and a key for the media.UPDATE 11/14/15I was hoping to upgrade my review of this machine as I learned more about it but instead I discoveredthe restore disks are for crappy windoze 8 and I do not even see a license key anywhere on them.Far worse is that not only is there no way to burn a restore copy of disks of windows 7 from the D: partition, thereis no windows 7 key sticker  on the bottom of the machine!We are down to 2 stars after having it about 6 hours.  If they did not jack me around like it looks like they have it would have a 4 star rating rather than 2.=====================================Let me start by first saying that I love Lenovo.  They IMHO make a better productthan most of the competition....I bought the E1 processor, and paid $199 for it 4 days ago. I am not sure what jacking the price is all about.....I think that some new listings start with a low price to generate reviews and also to see what price they can get.I have had it only a matter of hours, and I find it extremely slow! Perhaps I will look into how much memory it can hold.That being said I thin that this is a great laptop even for the current $260 price.I am thinking of putting my extra data on a NAS or even an external HD to overcome the limitations of the 300 GB Hard drive.That or I may put in a 1TB drive, which should be easy as they included 4 DVD restore disks for this laptopl. You do not even have to burn them yourself!I will update as I become familiar with this particular laptop....
