Great Little Machine
Great little machine. Neat and sturdy. Using MS Office, Sage Accounting Software and Skype - have had no problems. The battery life is good and I love the instant gratification from solid state memory. (No extended waiting while the system boots) Yes the memory storage is limited, but slim external hard disks are pretty inexpensive. I have not missed the lack of touch screen and the price was very reasonable.
