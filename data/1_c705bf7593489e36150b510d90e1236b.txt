Quite good, not perfect.
The ergonomics are great: nice size, weight. Plenty of USB connections. Speakers are quiet, I wouldn't be able to hear them if there was any background noise. For the most part I use headphones or earbuds and the sound quality is fine. Basic function of trackpad has been fine but I use a mouse most of the time.The keyboard is better than expected...as nice as any laptop keyboard I've had. Some reviewers complain about the power button's location but it's been a non-issue for me.The display is sharp and easy to read, but seems to go a bit greenish during video playback. I didn't want touchscreen and haven't missed it.Great battery life. I'm off and on the computer throughout the day. The battery rarely dips below 50%. No complaints with the charging time.The fan has come on only during a McAfee scan. Otherwise this PC has been silent. It gets slightly warm on the bottom during video playback, but only a little. Not hot, just warm. Top stays cool.As other reviewers have noted, the video driver crashes. I see this about every other day.In addition, in the past week, the computer has had two hard crashes, both times while browsing with IE. This is a bit concerning since there's no unusual software installed.Not impressed with the McAfee LiveSafe, the Asus storage, or MS Edge. Windows 10 Home is usable, a good enough match for this hardware.In summary, I would buy again. Hope they get the bugs in the video driver fixed, as well as the system crashes.
