It has potential but the flaws are to great to ignore
I have been using a Logitec Revu forward years and had been fairlyhappy with the product dispite they lack of support aso when my second Google TV remote was destroyed by my toddler I thought it was a good time to upgrad . Unfortunately while it is faster than the Logite , the stability of the hardware and software suffers greatly.The set up process crashed multiple time and I could not pair my TV. I finally got the TV working by entering the code for a different Samsung TV which provided basic control. Although you can use your Android phone as a remotes their featured is near worthless since the box always powers itself down and can only be turners on with t the dedicated remote. Also, it can't even keep network time synchronized. It was having issues with turning WiFi off for no apparent reason forcing you to reenable it from the settings menu so I had to hard wire the network connectivity for reliability. One good software update might be able to fix this but as off now it sucks and is being returned.
