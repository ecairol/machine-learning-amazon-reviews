Overall good laptop
So far this laptop is pretty good. It is really light and thin which is fantastic and it looks pretty slick also. The keyboard is great and feels just like the one on Macbooks. The track pad is that smooth and there is a louder clicking noise when you click on it. One complaint I have is that the AC adapter for it is so short! They have made it similar to the Macbook one in the sense that it has the square-ish part that connects to the outlet, but Macbooks come with the longer extension cables. This laptop does not! So the cable is extremely short which isn't ideal. Another thing to note is on the description of the product at the top, it says 1 HDMI port. This is wrong! It has 1 MICRO-HDMI port. This is listed correctly later on in the longer description but can be misleading for potential buyers since HDMI is much more conventional than micro-HDMI, which can be a deal breaker for people.
