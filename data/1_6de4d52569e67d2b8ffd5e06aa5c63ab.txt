Buy it!
I've had this computer for about 3 months now and I love it! The battery is super long lasting which is great (I'm a college student and I love never having to bring my charger to campus with me), it's super light, and it's worked great for me so far! I upgraded it to windows 10 when I bought it and had some issues with the scroll feature on the mouse pad (two finger scroll wasn't working) but eventually was able to get it to work by reinstalling a driver I think. I also have had the display driver fail and restart a few times (screen will go black for 1-2 seconds, come back with a message saying the display driver failed and recovered). The computer battery also gets pretty hot when it's plugged in and charging and I'm using it sometimes, but this is mostly when I have it in my lap or bed (not so much when it's on a table). Other reviews say the touchpad feels cheap, which it kind of does when you click down on it. I mostly just use a tap on the touchpad to click and I don't have to deal with the slightly clunky touchpad. It isn't terrible but definitely isn't great. I'd say that's probably the worst feature of the computer. The speakers don't get too loud, but loud enough for watching shows or listening to music somewhere not too loud. So far the computer has been very fast and able to handle pretty much everything I've thrown at it. The one time it kind of glitched out was when I was running MATLAB (a program for engineering classes) and was trying to run a really long script, and the computer eventually either quit out of the program or gave an error about not having enough memory. I then ran the script on a computer on campus and that computer wasn't able to run it either, so I don't think it's much of a shortcoming. Overall so far I love this computer, huge step up from my last laptop which was about 4 years old and SO slow, and affordable for a poor college student! Definitely would recommend.
