VERY good laptop for everyday work.
I have read a lot of negative reviews about this laptop here and all I can say is that either computer illiterate people are buying these or people are not reading the specs before ordering.  This laptop is just as I ordered. It is a VERY NICE laptop.  Setup took about a half an hour. It was  very simple. I ordered this laptop KNOWING that it did NOT come with a optical drive. Seeing as though external drives are cheap enough that did not bother me a bit.  My first Windows update took about 2 hours (NO big deal) and went smoothly. I got the Windows 10  update icon on the taskbar and reserved my FREE update.  So far (3 days) the laptop is running great. It only took about 2 days to get used to Windows 8.1 (I'm used to Windows 7 and Linux Mint), it's not that bad to figure out and learn.  There is not that much bloatware on this machine and it took only a few minutes to uninstall what I didn't want. Go through the settings and configure the machine the way you want, it's very easy.  The laptop is very quiet. I installed a Staples 4 port USB hub and added a wireless mouse with no problems at all. Plug & play. I installed Firefox as I HATE I.E. and imported my bookmarks with zero problems.  I can recommend this laptop without hesitation. It works great. If you're looking for a high end laptop this is NOT for you. Do your homework and stop complaining because you didn't do any  research. READ  ALL  INFORMATION before you order ANY product so you know what you will get.  If you have questions about the NON optical drive version of this laptop just ask me.
