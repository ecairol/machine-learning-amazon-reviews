Cheap plastic, windows experience. Had to buy for a PC required issue. Bought other used Macs that were a pleasure to use right out of the box, and much better quality. If I didn't need it for a business situation I would drop kick this right into a trash can.How anyone can use the intrusive and badly designed windows system is beyond me. Terrible.Couldn't even shut it down without it running for hours downloading new software. Couldn't install drivers or transfer a folder of pictures without going through a mess.Do your self a favor, buy a used Mac and don't be a slave to this piece of junk.
