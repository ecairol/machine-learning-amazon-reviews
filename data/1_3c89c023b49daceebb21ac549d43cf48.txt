Good: Great processor
I have only been using my chromebook for a couple days.Good: Great processor, super fast, very easy to set up. I've been writing a lot and I haven't had a single problem using the chromebook. It syncs very easily with other email programs as well - only downside is that anything you open on the chromebook will be added to Docs. This may not be great if anything you do is confidential or shouldn't go into your personal google drive. Aesthetically, the chromebook looks great! So far so good on battery life, but I haven't really tested it out.Bad: This isn't terrible, but like others said - it's a trade off in screen quality and processing power. The screen is definitely a little fuzzy. I find this annoying, but since I need it to process more than I need great graphics, I'll probably just keep it. Something that I just noticed in my very quiet office today: The computer emits a slightly high pitched whine as it chugs away. It's a little more noticeable than other computers I have had. I don't know if it's enough to get rid of it - and really, other chromebooks probably do something similar - but if you're prone to headaches, this may be a concern. Still a small concern though.
