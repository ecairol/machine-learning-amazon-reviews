"It excels and does poorly on many aspects"
Pros:-Fast computer, didn't experience any lag yet.-Doesn't look cheap and build quality is quite good.-Windows 10 is smooth and probably the best version of windows yet visually and functionality.-Has all the necessary ports and ample amount of usb input (4). Though I wished they should have just made them all usb 3.0 rather than including 2 usb 2.0-Has useful features like back-lit keyboard and number pad.Cons-Huge disappointment is the lcd screen which has terrible color reproduction and is not very bright.-Speakers aren't very loud and below the standard. Probably only half as loud as my macbook pro 13.-For an entertainment laptop with 1080p screen and good graphic card, having a poor display and sound is a huge turn off.-Touch pad is terrible, and keyboard isn't that great either. The surface of the touchpad isn't smooth which makes it hard to navigate. Buy a mouse, otherwise the touchpad will hold you down. Keyboard requires harder press than usual, which can hinder typing fast.-This laptop doesn't look as close to the blue color pictured here, it is actually closer to black or brown. Not complaining about the look personally, but i think this could be considered false advertisement.
