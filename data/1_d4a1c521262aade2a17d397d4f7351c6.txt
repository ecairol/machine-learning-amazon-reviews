Decent
I wasn't expecting too much from this being that is a cheap laptop.  I just wanted it for basic web browsing and Microsoft Office applications.  I have yet to download Microsoft and I'm a little nervous too because I've had problems with a few very basic things.  I have noticed that the RAM completely will top out when I do something as simple as opening the My Computer folder.  I'm not sure what is causing this, but could be a problem in the long run.
