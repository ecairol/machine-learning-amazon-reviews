Biggest piece of s*** product
WORST money spent I have ever experienced! II bought this computer on Christmas. It is now January 22 and my computer will no longer work. It all the sudden two days ago was having pop up come up non stop saying that my computer might have gotten a virus i went to the store and bought a virus protector for my computer, spent about 100 dollars on this software. Last night i was having problems yet again with the computer and this morning i woke up and the thing doesn't even want to turn on. When i hooked it up to my charger it would turn on but then went to  black screen. i was very disappointed with the way amazon handled the situation when i had called. I had two day shipping on this item and they wanted me to return the item. (do i remind you i use this computer for work and school which has all my banking information on it, patients social security information on it, and any other important information on it..) very very disappointed! do not waste your money on this piece of S***! promise you, its nothing but issue after issue
