Fails at light browsing, consistent freezing
First one I purchased had dead pixels so I exchanged through Amazon with no problem.  The second one I received seemed ok at first but what I've learned is this thing is woefully inept at keeping pace with even moderate browsing activity.  It freezes constantly with ONE tab open.  I've tried powerwashing (the Asus version of complete reset of the device) multiple times and it only helps for a short while.  My main use for this was for very light browsing, and to read SD cards in the woods from my game cameras using a plugin USB SD card reader.  It fails at this task as well.  Reading the SD card takes more than a few moments, and once I have the pictures open and begin to scroll through, the Asus freezes every single time.  I rated 2 stars based on the ONLY pro, it's great battery life of 10-12 hours.  But what good is battery life if you spend the majority of the time waiting for the computer to respond?
