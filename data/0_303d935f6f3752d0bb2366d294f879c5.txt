Bad Apple Care, Nice Product
It's a nice product, although it has only 1Gb of ram and apps close by themselves pretty often.But the reason I give this product 2 stars is because my iPad was defective, so I sent it to Apple and they confirmed it was defective, and then they sent me a working one, but it was used and had some marks on the back and the sides...I'm not that mad, at least they changed it, but for all the trouble that it caused me, I was expecting a new one, or at least a used one with no marks, why did I take so much care of mine in the first place? Now the one they gave me is a tougher sell if I want to buy the next newer version and get rid of this one.
