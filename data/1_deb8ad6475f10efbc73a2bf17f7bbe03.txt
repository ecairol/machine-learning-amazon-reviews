The screen drives me crazy, but for the price you can't have everything
For the price you can't expect a 15" macbook pro (which I have used for years).  It is the bottom end here.- screen is just bad.  poor viewing angle, not very bright, not high contrast, fonts just look blurry and gray (maybe a chromeos thing, it's at native resolution), colors not saturated, ....  I bought this for someone as a gift, but if I was buying for myself I'd get an IPS screen.- screen aspect ratio of 16x9 - I hate it.  for web browsing, I want 16x10.  At least you can move the "taskbar" to the left, and there's a dedicated full screen button, but my wife couldn't stand the full screen hiding her menu bar.  your mileage may vary.  I am glad I got the 13" version though, I don't think I could stand anything smaller.- chrome os: google appears to have a "5 year from product introduction" software support policy.  google "chrome os end of life policy" for details.  I guess 5 years is ok, but I would prefer a bit longer for security updates.- minor things: stupid stickers on the keyboard (the intel inside one takes a lot of rubbing with a microfiber to get the gunk off), and it does show fingerprint grease like nothing else.  the brushed plastic look is nice looking otherwise, though.- on the positive, you can map the "caps lock/search" button to other things, like CONTROL!.  Yay!  I've done that for a long time on my mac and its much more ergonomic for my pinky.- the track pad is alright, as is the keyboard.  slight lag in scrolling web pages, maybe cpu related.- HDMI port works to play stuff like netflix full screen, not too hard to set up, and it remembers your settingsConclusion: comparing to my MBP, it's ok except the quality of the LCD screen drives me crazy.  I'd spend 100 more in hope of getting a better display, if I was going to be looking at it for hour(s) a day.
