great value
For the price this computer is fantastic. I needed something for everyday use, browsing, email, office ect... for under 300 this was awesome. Sure you can find better but you will have to pay for itI give it 4 stars because there are some things (perhaps I'm not used to) that really aren't user friendly. The volume is hard to adjust, same with the screen brightness. And the lack of scrolling with the pad kinda sucks. Maybe I'll figure them out as time goes on but it just isn't intuitive.
