Perfect for older people
I bought this for my mother who would not be able to deal with Windows 8 and equally would have no idea where to start with a Mac. She needs a keyboard and does not like tablets. The Chromebook is excellent particularly with offline capability. As others have written, the screen is not great but at this price, the value is excellent.
