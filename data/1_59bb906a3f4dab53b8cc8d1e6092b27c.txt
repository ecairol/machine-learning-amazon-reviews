It's perfect. The speakers are fairly good
Pros:-One thing you can't judge too well on the pictures, even after reading the description, is the sheer size of the screen. It's perfect. The speakers are fairly good, definitely adequate for streaming music, watching Netflix, etc.-Price! A full laptop, not a netbook (even without an optical drive), it does not feel like a netbook. I bought this to replace my broken Chromebook, and I'm definitely liking this much more.-App Store = About time, Windows!Cons:-The laptop does not come with a dvd/bluray drive, but this is already a given, since the description says it. (Not really a con, I guess, since everything is now downloadable)-The trackpad/mousepad is a complete joke. I tried calibrating every which way to get a better feel for it, and it's pretty bad. The gestures are ok, such as scrolling by using two fingers on the right edge as if on a touch screen. I guess windows 8 is really more optimized for touch screen computers.
