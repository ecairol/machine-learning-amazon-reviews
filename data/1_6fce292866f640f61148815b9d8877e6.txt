Overall good, with one design drawback (for me)
Love the Chrome OS.  This processor is a little slow (have the 4gb model).  Build quality, screen, keyboard, trackpad are all great.  I hate the fact that the bottom is rounded, so it bounces around my desk when I rest my wrists on the bottom edge of the laptop.  I would buy again but that rocking when i put my wrists down is really annoying and pointless...
