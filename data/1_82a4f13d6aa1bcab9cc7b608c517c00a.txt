Great laptop, but still has some issues.
This is a very well thought out laptop.  BUT, mine went back for a few reasons.  Mainly that it died on the third day (failed to find a bootable drive).  Besides that, my main gripe with the laptop is the touchpad.  It is small and very sensitive, I found it nearly unusable.  In addition, it is a Microsoft Trackpad (not Synaptics) and you cannot turn off click to tap, which for me causes frequent errors.The other thing I did not like much was that the SD card sticks out - not a huge issue as you can now buy small cards / micro SD adapters, but that is just more money.As others have said the screen is beautiful and Dell did a great job of shrinking the keyboard... the keys you rarely use got smaller and the keys you use a lot stayed full size or near it.The keyboard is back lit with two levels of brightness, but when it is off, it is totally off.  The key to turn on the back light itself is not lit so you need to poke around or find a little light to find it. HP does it better, keeping the light toggle key lit at all times.I may buy this again when Windows 10 comes up.  I hope they revise the touchpad drivers.  Otherwise, I'll resign myself to keeping a mouse nearby.
