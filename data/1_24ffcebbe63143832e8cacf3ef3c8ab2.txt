Happy so far
This computer has done the trick for me so far.  The keyboard took a little getting used to, but now I type as fast as ever.  Touchpad is okay, but I normally use a mouse.  Now, this computer earned 4 stars as a function of its price point.  It is missing bluetooth and an optical drive.  I would have rated it 5 stars if it had EITHER bluetooth or an optical drive.
