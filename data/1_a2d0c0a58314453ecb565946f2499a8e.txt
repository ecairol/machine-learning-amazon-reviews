Great All Around PC
Been using this ASUS Chromebook for several months now with great success so far. It provides instant on access, very responsive keyboard and great battery life. I use it to browse the web, answer email, shop and to access our desktop PC remotely. Battery life is as advertised and most of the time the Chomebook is unplugged from power.My only complaint would be the display. It is the standard 1366X768 resolution that is typical for most Chromebooks. This resolution is OK for nearly every use, but when I remote to our desktop PC which has large monitors, it would be great to have higher resolution. Additionally, as noted in other reviews, the colors on the display appear a little washed out.Overall, very satisfied with this ASUS Chromebook and it provides great value for the price that I paid.
