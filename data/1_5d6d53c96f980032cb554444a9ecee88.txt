I am disappointed with this order but chose to live with it ...
I was shocked that DVD ROM was excluded with this purchased while was totally unaware when placing the order. Besides, on the main product display picture, Win Office is shown which was one of the reasons I chose this product. I am disappointed with this order but chose to live with it because I need a laptop badly because my old Apple was down.
