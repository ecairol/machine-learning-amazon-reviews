Exactly What I Expected
I've had my Asus CB approx 1 month. I love the security and ease of use, no security updates, ever. Have not noticed any problems w/speed with numerous tabs open. Watch Netflix, Pandora music and I Heart Radio [not at the same time] all without a problem. I purchased the 13 inch as I am of retirement age. The 11 inch would be slightly lighter but I suggest a compromise between the size and weight and go with the 13 inch. The weight is great. My son comments often about how light it is as compared to a conventional laptop. The screen does need to be adjusted at times to get the correct angle for optimal viewing. [as noted in other reviews] I use Google Docs for numerous spreadsheets. Great to have them available from anywhere and secure. The battery life has been fantastic. The CB gets used every day. I move it from my office to the living area to the bedroom. I recharge 1 - 2 times per week. No problem with cloud printing. I use a mouse, ext HD and ext keyboard approx 50% of the time. No problems with them connecting. The boot up time from SLEEP is almost instant. I would definitely recommend this CB for those that understand using Chrome OS and want ease of use, portability and hassle free security.
