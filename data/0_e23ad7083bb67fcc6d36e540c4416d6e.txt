Very Dissatisfied
I received this chromebook in March.  The touch pad was somewhat difficult to depress and move to the next desired screen but I wasn't overly concerned.  In the last few weeks the touch pad has become extremely difficult to depress and at 6'1 I use both hands now to depress the touch pad.  Unfortunately I am well past the return date.  I would advise anyone to steer clear of this product and am awaiting to see if the company responds to this review.  If so I will update.
