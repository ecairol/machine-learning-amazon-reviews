Great until the screen shorted out
It was great for the first five months, but then the screen developed a short and wouldn't turn on when you opened the laptop. I was not treating it roughly and carried it in a padded backpack. One more thing to consider with any chromebook is you have to plan ahead to download documents if you want to use it offline.Pros: nice keyboard with good action, fantastic battery life, very lightweight
