Best Chromebook Experience Yet
I was in the market for a 11.6" Chromebook, I already went in knowing I enjoy the Google eco system. Chromebooks I have used as my main laptop until I recently purchased a Macbook Pro for the Adobe Creative Cloud.  They are now my portable companion for around the house and taking on the go. I recently sold my HP Chromebook 11 due to the terrible battery life. I was only getting about 2 hours on a single charge, everything else I loved about it. I was looking a the new $150 laptops (hisense, haier) when I came across this machine from Asus. The selling point to me was the battery life and clean professional looking keyboard. I received it today and I can give you my first impressions. I purchased the 4gb ram model.Pros:- Long battery life, if its anything near 13 hours I will be thrilled.- Case color, it is really a dark navy blue unlike the pictures. I was concerned about this but was relieved when seeing it in person.- Keyboard feels great and keys have a nice texture to them.- Quality, feels nice and light and does not flex. Feels quality made.Cons:I knew the cons going in but I would of rather had a full size HDMI instead of a mini HDMI. No SD card slot. Charger is a proprietary, the Chromebook 11 had a micro USB but most of these do not. It is a nice small charger compared to most laptops.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase, this is my third Chromebook and looks to be the best one yet.
