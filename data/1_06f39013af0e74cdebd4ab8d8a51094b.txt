Great simple device for web and social networking
This is my first chromebook and I have to say that I'm impressed.  It does exactly what I need it to do - easy access to web and social networking sites with a nice screen size and full keyboard.  The build quality is very good for such an inexpensive notebook and I haven't noticed any lagging or performance issues which I was a little worried about based on online reviews.  The display isn't awesome, but I didn't expect it to be at this price.  It's perfectly fine though.I had considered an inexpensive Windows PC, but I'm ultimately glad I didn't.  Chromebook updates are amazingly fast, the notebook is secure from viruses and malware, and I don't have to worry about all the stuff that comes along with a Windows PC that I frankly don't need.  I'll still always keep a full primary computer whether Windows or Mac, but this is a great device for what I need it to do.
