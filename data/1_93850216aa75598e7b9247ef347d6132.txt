Happy with my purchase so far
Have used my new laptop for one day only. So far I'm happy with my purchase. It's light and beautiful. The battery works well for me (approx. 10h at normal use). And it's fast! Haven't had problems with the touchpad, screen, or wifi-connection as other customers mentioned in their reviews. It's a good deal compared to other brands' models with similar features.
