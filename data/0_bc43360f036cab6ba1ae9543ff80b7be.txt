Poor computer with a good screen.
I had had several IBMs / Lenovo's. I was happy with most of the thinkpads. But as time goes by, Lenovo is dropping the IBM legacy. The only good thing of this laptop is the screen. The rest is just quite poor. A touch-pad without physical buttons is useless. 2.4GHz only Wifi is backwards. 2 USB ports only and only one of them 3.0 is quite poor. Building quality is far from good. Possibly the last Lenovo I will have.
