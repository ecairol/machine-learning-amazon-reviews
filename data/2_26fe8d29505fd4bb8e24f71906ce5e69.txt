Mac Mini Use
I purchased this camera for my Mac Mini from Best Buy today.  I was worried because so many user reviews on different websites complained that the Webcam was *Not* Mac Compatible.  Simply Not True.First Off I am running OSX 10.8, so here is what I did 1) Took it out of the Box 2) set it on top of my Monitor 3) Plugged it into the USB port.  Then I launched every single one of these apps (FaceTime, Skype, Yahoo Messenger, PhotoBooth, iMovie and Quicktime).  These apps all did what they are expected to do, be it record video and/or take photo's.  The quality is pretty amazing, it's clearer than the camera on my iPhone 4S.  I'm not really concerned with the controls and such but just in case I decide I want to play with those down the road I downloaded iGlasses to adjust the camera settings.
