Good laptop for the money!
Bought this laptop for a friend and she absolutely loves it. I can't speak/write for her, but she states this Asus Win8.1 (with Classic Shell Start Button) laptop is a great improvement over her older WinXP laptop. I was impressed with its specs and speed while setting it up.
