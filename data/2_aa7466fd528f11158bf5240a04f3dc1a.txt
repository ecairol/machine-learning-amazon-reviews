Very good value for very good performance.
I bought this for my son after comparing it to numerous comparable devices.  Our big debate was whether to go with the i5 and a fan or the m5 and no fan.  My son prevailed, and we for the more powerful i5.  Battery life is not a problem:  it is over 8 hours.  It's super light and very portable.  The aluminum case is attactive and seems durable.  The SSD is amazingly fast.  This thing is up and running from a cold start in just a few seconds.  I will "never ever get back together" with a traditional hard drive after watching this in action!  The only downside is that the keyboard is not backlit.  Overall, we are very impressed with this Zenbook, and I feel that we got a great laptop at a very reasonable price.
