A great computer with a couple things I don't like
disappointed that it didn't have a DVD. picture looked like it did and others stated on cd/dvd.  Also you don't know if capital lock is on and cause problems when logging in.  Other than those two things the computer is great. not a windows 8 fan . installed start 8 and now I have some of window 7 features back.
