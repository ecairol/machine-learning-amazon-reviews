It is worth the money you pay
I think this laptop is definetely a good one for the price. It was $267 when I bought it. My only complaint is the mouse track I was having hard time getting used to it. But it is harder to click ob things. After being used to mac, it was harder getting used to. But other than that this unit is fast enough and doesnt get really warm. I had several excel files open and working with large files & formulas, and didnt slow down.
