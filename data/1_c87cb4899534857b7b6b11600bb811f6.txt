No CD/DVD drive!
This unit does not have a CD/DVD drive that we thought it did when we ordered. The exchange process is nearly impossible.  It would have been nice for it to be clear that the unit does NOT have the drive.  Now we are looking at having to purchase an external drive in order to load software.  So much for a great deal.
