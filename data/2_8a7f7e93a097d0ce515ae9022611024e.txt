Because of my job, I use to travel a lot, and 2 laptops on your shoulder (one for work, one personal).. mmm you better get a slim and light computer is you want to be comfortable. This computer is great for overall use, very fast, very light and thin! (did I mentioned is super light?), I'm a photography enthusiast so even Photoshop CC and Lightroom CC run nice and fast. Windows startup in 4 or 5 secs, office 2013 runs really smooth. Battery life is really good. What else can I say? if you need a light computer with great quality/performance/price ratio, don't look for more, this is the choice to go.
