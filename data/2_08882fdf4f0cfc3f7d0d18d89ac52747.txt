raised my rating by a star, a pleasure to use, chrome has benefits
Recieved promptly, no need for 2 day delivery.Pros;Excellent look and build quality, bought the blue version. Keyboard is easy to use and I love the black on white contrast. Priced right for a 13 incher. Perfect size for toting to starbux. Videos play fine. Horses for courses. Keeping the big quad core at home for heavy use.Cons; just a slight lag on multi-tasking,but nothing like the atom netbook it is replacing. Some apprehension about the limited hard drive size and possibly having to buy and use a memory card.If you know and like chrome this is a good choice. I am rapidly getting to appreciate the many benefits of the system.
