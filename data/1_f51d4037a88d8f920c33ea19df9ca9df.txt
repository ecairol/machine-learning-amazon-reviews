I am having issues with my Asus Chromebook C300MA
I think its ok because when its working I simply enjoy such ease it comes with. I however got some challenges with one I bought Asus Chromebook C300MA through Amazon here sometime in May 2015.I have a challenge, someday last 3weeks, I tried to log in to Admin as I lock it, but it kept saying that my password was wrong when I was very sure of it, I cant remember what I clicked and it says that I will not be able to access my files except the ones synchronised. After this I was able to enter with my same password it rejected. Now I cannot access all my old files especially all I have in Downloads, my book am working on, Applications, images and so much more. Please I need help on how to recover it all please.Again it hangs and restarts itself often, I am thinking it's too early for all these to be happening or could there be something I am not doing right? Thank you.
