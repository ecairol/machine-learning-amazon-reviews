I love this laptop
The quality is incredible. I love this laptop! I bought it after long weeks of careful reading of reviews. My choice was between Dell XPS 3, MacBook and this one. I am very happy with this choice. I have it since five days and so far it works fantastically!Pluses:- aluminum body is very robust yet light and beautiful & stylish- keyboard quality is great. Easy to press and nice for a touch keys- the screen is amazing. Excellent HD quality- fast!!!- Windows 10 positively surprised me- 10 hours of battery use at normal rate!! I love it.Minuses (which are minor for me):- the 2 USB drives are to the left which makes it not so convenient for me to operate with a mini-mouse. I am a right-hand so I'd prefer if they'd be to the right as well- same about power charger slot. It is to the right, I'd prefer it to be to the left- the "power" button is one of the keyboard buttons and is right next to the "delete" button which makes me be careful and slows down writing a little bitOverall, amazing quality and I love my new ultrabook. Totally recommend it.
