Very functional laptop for the money! Does everything the average person really needs to do, email, web, office, etc etc..The only catch is no CDROM!  But, I hardly need one so a USB attached CDROM can work just fine. Only two USB slots which is a bit limited. One of which is a high power USB slot - thought this'd be great for the ipad but it will not work with my ipad from some bizarre reason, keep connecting, disconnecting repeatedly. Still..... despite it all, I'm quite happy with this laptop.
