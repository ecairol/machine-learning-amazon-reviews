Great product, but wait for a deal on the price
A chromebook is a much cleaner computer if all you do is access websites, watch video, play youtube and make light use of documents and spreadsheets. In exchange for trading away your ability to, say, edit video, use Photoshop and play compute intensive games, you get a simple device that requires virtually no maintenance. Battery life is impressive, as are boot-up times. The device is light and does not contain a hard disk. You get a great deal from Google currently for cloud storage (1TB free for two years).With all this said, I believe Chromebooks ought to be much cheaper than what they are currently retailing for. During the Holiday 2014 season, I saw 2GB/32GB Chromebooks priced on par with 4GB/500GB Windows laptops. The former are much simpler than the latter, and there is no reason they should not be priced significantly cheaper than Windows laptops.I did buy this Chromebook for a Thanksgiving day special price from Amazon (hundred and fifty dollars) which I believe should be the everyday price of this product.
