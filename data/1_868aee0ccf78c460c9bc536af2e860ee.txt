I love my Asus Chromebook
I love my Asus Chromebook.  It is red too and love that.  The screen is 13 Inches and I love that.  It does lag when I type often, but  I can live with that.  Chromebooks are notoriously slow also, but that is okay. Here is the bad part, I am going to have to send it in on warranty and I don't like that, because I don't know how to do it and I run a business on it.  God help me.  The only good thing is I will buy another one because they are only $179 before I send this one off to be fixed.The problem I am having is when the top flips up my screen does unusual things and it is getting worst.  When this happens nothing is visible until you move or adjust the top a tiny bit.
