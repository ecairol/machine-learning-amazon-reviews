The ASUS is not only lightweight but is an appealing unit. My wife loved the computer upon opening & thought it would be perfect for her travel. But the computer only worked great for about two weeks. She is no longer able to open several applications at the same time & the computer is slower than ever. We wanted to return the item and maybe exchange it for the same unit as there is a lot of great reviews about this unit, but unfortunately the time lapse for returning the unit has expired.
