A great webcam for a regular monitor, not for laptops
I had previously purchased the predecessor to the Logitech C920, the C910, and I was interested in seeing what improvements, if any, Logitech had made to an already excellent webcam. Physically, the two look very similar, but the C920 has a somewhat smaller body and adds a tripod socket, greatly expanding its usefulness. Like the 910, the 920 has an articulating base, but the 920's base has been subtly redesigned to fit better in more situations. Neither of them really work all that well on the thin bezel of a laptop - they're more meant for a desktop monitor - but the 920 with more hinge points will be easier to position. The 920 can even sit on a desk, though the angle is probably not so good for most use.An addition not immediately visible is that the C920 has its software built-in - just plug it in to a Windows PC and it will self-install the software. (Mac users can download software from the Logitech web site.)  The software includes some silly thing that will superimpose a cartoonish face on your eyes and lips - this didn't work well for me and I can't imagine who would want to use it on a regular basis.The picture quality from the C920 was superb, as was the audio. One can zoom the picture but no panning feature is provided.
