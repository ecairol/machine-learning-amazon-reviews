Good, but watch out for adware.
Works perfectly fine, came very well packaged. No pre-installed office software, however, it also came with 3 pre-installed adware/malware items. I thankfully already had a virus protector that would destroy these simple threats, but for an unaware user, these could be potentially hazardous.Adware:PullupdateWeb shieldWebbarPup pro pc cleanerStorm alerts
