Pretty darn good, I'm happy!
My biggest concern was if the core M processor would be enough. I really only use this to access the web, read email, watch a few videos and use a few MS Office products. After 10 days of use there is plenty of power for casual users. It comes out of sleep mode in a couple of seconds, a reboot is around 10 seconds. The track-pad works fine, yes the left and right "buttons" are a little noisy but it's the way it was designed and I'm getting used to it. The only thing that bugs me is the home/end/up/down keys; if you want to go to the top or bottom of a page you can't just hit the key - you have to hold the function key down. I miss the home/end keys but I'm getting used to it.I didn't have any problems "out of the box" and I installed Windows 10 the same day I got it. It's doing what I wanted at a pretty good price and I'm pretty happy with it.
