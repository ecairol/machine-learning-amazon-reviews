Really good, light effective
I've had this for six months...the screen seems to be getting a bit of a short....otherwise great! Great battery life...great backup to my Mac...UPDATE I'm on a year and the screen has pretty much shorted out...I could open the lid about 30 degrees otherwise the backlight would turn off. Not sure what's up...
