The only laptop I ever regreted buying
I really loved the size of this little laptop, the weight and the 'flexibility'. So I bought it in November 2014. I've had it now for almost a year.Right from the beginning one can realize the huge amounts of junk software that Lenovo adds to it. And knowing what you can uninstall and what not takes some research to do. Then, I read the news that it was confirmed that Lenovo added tons of malware as OEM and 'they stopped doing that'. Since when is this acceptable with a hardware company?The laptop is extremely slow even after uninstalling most of the software I have on it. Once I was completely unable to restart it for a couple of days! Then the touchpad is terrible! Every once in a while I really feel like I'd throw it over the window...I will never buy another Lenovo product ever again!
