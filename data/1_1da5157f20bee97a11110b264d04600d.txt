$200 worth of aggravation
Got a Chromebook for my Mom. I was prepared to LOVE Chromebook but 3 aggravating hours in, with the thing still stuck in 'Determining device configuration' mode, I think I may hate Chromebook already. Part of the issue is that it's set up to automatically check for updates. So instead of being able to enjoy starting it up and getting going, 3 hours later, it's still stuck on stupid. In about an hour, if it hasn't awakened, I am going to put it back into the box it came in, return it, and get a used macbook. I really do not need this aggravation.
