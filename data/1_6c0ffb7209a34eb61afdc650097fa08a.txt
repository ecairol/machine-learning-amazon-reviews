Some pros, but VERY EXTREME CONS.
This computer would be really great except Windows 8 completely ruined it. PLEASE BUY A DIFFERNET COMPUTER IF YOU CAN. I'm a college student and when the computer updates (without me telling it to update) it takes HOURS!!! I literally don't have time to wait for a computer to "load features" for two hours only for it to never come through and then have to refresh the entire computer and re-download Microsoft office to do my assignments taking another hour. DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU PLAN ON CHANGING THE OS. I have had to refresh this computer twice and I've only had it for a week. I do not recommend it. I called Asus and they also really don't have a long-term solution for this. I can't really write about the "pros" besides it being lightweight and the charger being small. Everything else is just average and when you throw in the horrible Os, it's not worth the money. The camera quality sucks, so don't think that you'll be using Skype or recording any videos. BUT the sound quality of the speakers are EXCELLENT! They are superb! Oh, and the battery lasts pretty long! I haven't really kept track but definitely 5 hours and up. Also, the battery is built in so if you ever need to get a new battery you will be SOL. The screen is a really nice size, and it's definitely not too big for class or carrying around campus. Just pray that when you turn it on it hasn't updated. So I give three stars, yes it has good speakers and a long battery life but when the hell will you be able to enjoy these if you keep having to refresh and update the computer?
