Good ultrabook, great for the price, not without minor issues.
Okay, so I've had this computer for about 5 months now. It's been a fantastic laptop for school and work, but it does have some minor issues.Pros:It's insanely light and small and the charger is tiny! It's super easy to pack this up and take it somewhere.It charges quickly and maintains a charge for about 5 hours of continuous use on moderate battery settings.The brushed metal casing has a great look and feel, and is pretty sturdy - haven't scratched it yet (knock on wood).Windows 8 actually works better than I had anticipated, especially considering this ultrabook is not a touch screen.It rarely heats up and is SILENT... gotta love that SSD and Intel chipset.Cons:The display driver crashes every so often and reboots - the screen goes dark, but it always starts back up within seconds. It's disconcerting, but it doesn't bother me too much. I would like to see a patch for that, though, just because I freak out a little every time it happens.The wi-fi adapter's connection speed drops to a crawl if I'm too far from the modem - and too far seems to be in the next room, which is pretty lame. Right now, I'm sitting about 12 feet from the box, and the connection is zippy. But if I walk into the kitchen, it takes AGES to load a page. None of my other devices have this issue, including my older Asus notebook that this replaced, and I'm certain it is not my modem/router.It's not a touch screen - boo.Overall, I am very happy with it, and the only standout issue is with the wifi adapter. I will update my review with the results if I find a way to either fix the adapter or if I purchase an external USB unit.
