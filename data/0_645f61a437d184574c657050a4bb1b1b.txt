Broke within days and had to return to Amazon.
From the moment we opened the box and the Chromebook refused to start up... well, we knew we had a problem. It was more drama over the next few days, and software updates caused the device to go dark (literally, the screen went dark) or just turned responsive. Sadly, my son had real work to do, so we sent it back and upgraded to a better machine. One that would work.
