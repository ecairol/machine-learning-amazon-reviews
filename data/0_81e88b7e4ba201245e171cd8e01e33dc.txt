After owning a few HP laptops I decided to purchase the lenovo Yoga 2 11 inch laptop.  It didn't take very long to discover that I made a big mistake.  The keyboard is terrible.  I can type pretty well but trying to get through even this review is somewhat of a task.  The internet is pretty sketchy.  It lags on most websites. I downloaded new drivers as recommended by a few people online but it still has its issues.  The ability to convert it into a tab is nice but It really isn't good for much more than just checking out the weather.
