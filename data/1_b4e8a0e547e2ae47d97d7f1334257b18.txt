Lover the iPads
If you are on this site, you are trying to decide whether to buy the iPad or another tablet such as Samsung or other device. I mentioned Samsung because I love their phones, tv's, etc. However, when comparing the note to the iPad, I opted for the iPad. One very big reason is I love to buy, rent, download movies to watch. Having an iTunes account makes this so very simple. Also, I have a ton of iTunes credit (I always ask for iTune gift cards whenever the occassion arises). In addition to iTunes, I love Pages. When I got this app, it was free! However, if you do a lot of word processing, you might want to invest in this much needed addition. The great thing about Pages is you can send as a PDF or Word doc via email.Some are trying to decide if they should buy a 16, 32, 64, etc. Speaking from experience, a 16 will not be enough for must adults, but would be fine for a child. I know you can store in the "cloud". However, you have to have a wifi in order to retrieve from the "cloud" unless you have the iPad with a cellular service (which to me, is a waste). So, having your documents available whenever needed is a plus. Therefore, a minimum of 32 would be great.All said, I love gadgets and technology. I love having the latest, and that is why with each new model, I will upgrade. However, I think this iPad air will be mine for many years - of course I say that until the next iPad air comes out with the finger print scanner and I will tell myself, "must have".If you own one, enjoy! If you are contemplating purchasing, make the plunge (you can return it if not satisfied to most places including Amazon).
