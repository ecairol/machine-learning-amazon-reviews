Not great but not horrible.
To be honest I only bought this computer because I needed a windows based computer for a class in college. This computer reminds me of a bare basic American car...Plastic, cheap cheap plastic and no frills yet still functional. It gets the job done as a functional laptop, yet it is rather slow and jumpy. The track pad could definitely use some fine tuning as it either does not respond or is all over the place.  Overall what can you say about a $250 laptop, you get what you pay for. Not super impressed but my bank account loved it.
