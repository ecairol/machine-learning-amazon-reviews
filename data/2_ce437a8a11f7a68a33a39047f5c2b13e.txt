Great Chromebook overall
My only gripe with this machine is that you have to manually log out. It will never lock or log out the current user unless specifically told to do so. It's not a huge deal for us, but it is annoying. Perhaps there is a setting in Chrome OS that would change that.Otherwise, great machine. Its very fast and light, no connection issues and the battery life is outstanding.
