Signature edition sucks
As a foreigner most of the time I just imitate what English speakers say without a deep understanding of how they actually feel emotionally. But thanks to the experience with St. Louis Galleria Microsoft Sore store, I actually feel the phrase "It sucks". I bought a Surface Pro 3 with them last year and went back for a Dell XPS 13 i7 version. However when I came home and unboxed, I found the plastic packaging had obviously been opened. I went back for a brand new one, and I was told the one I bought was a brand new one, at least 4 people there told me it's the "signature edition" and all the "signature edition" laptops are opened by "technicians" to remove bloatware. People here even left notes when they scratched my car, so I believed them but returned it because it's unimaginable for me that 4 people would lie to me. But today I suddenly realized there is another chance for me to feel English. If they were telling me the truth, then I will feel "Sorry, how stupid I am"; if they were lying just to sell me the used one, then I will feel "Yeah I was ****ed". Anyway it's a terrible experience
