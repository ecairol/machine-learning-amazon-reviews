I like everything about this with the exception of two major issues.  The volume is so poor, I can barely hear.  I find myself holding the chrome book up to my ear to try and hear.  The other big issue is the mouse.  It does not move often and I have to continue to fight it in order to get it to finally take and move where I need it to be.  Another irritating issue, there is no delete button.  If I make a mistake, I have to take extra steps and "backspace" in order to make the correction.  Don't understand why this simple and much needed key is not included.
