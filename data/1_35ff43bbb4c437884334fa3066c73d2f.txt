Okay, seems to be a little flimsy.
I purchased this for Sweetie; she wanted a laptop/tablet replacement for her aging, failing 11-year-old Gateway desktop computer.Not being up on Windows 8, I couldn't help her do more than power it up.  As I recall, there are virtually no ports -- maybe a USB port. Without connectivity, it does her little good.  Finally, I was able to get my systems guy over to get her WiFi connected. and synchronized; and it worked as expected.However, she found out she really missed having a desktop computer, so I got her a build up new one -- and she has two of them.Sweetie's only complaint is that is "feels flimsy, like I'm going to break it easily". So, she doesn't use it often.I've "played" with it a little, and it seems to function well.
