The specs on this machine may be great. But to get to appreciate them through Windows 8.1 is virtually impossible. So, for another $100 you can upgrade to 8.1 Pro but you CANNOT downgrade to 7.Something else to consider is you're purchasing a Dell. That was smart 6 years ago but as of now, you're better off with no support. No call is worth the aggravation or time, as unless you're looking to show department racquet ball points, you will most likely not get the answers you deserve or desire.I'm an IT admin, have intimate Linux and Windows experience. I can say honestly that no time I have invested in this machine has been worth it. If I were a tablet user, ignorantly expecting just the same on a PC it'd be awesome.But the machine is limited by Windows.
