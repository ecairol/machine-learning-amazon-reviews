OK for watching netflix and looking at cat pictures online
Just wanted to point out that it is not a Windows computer, it runs Chrome OS, so Windows programs will not work (Firefox, Skype, Microsoft office etc.), everything is to be done via Chrome browser and its extensions. If you want to find out if Chromebooks are for you, simply run Chrome on your Windows computer, forget about any other programs, and see if it is enough for you.This is clearly a budget Chromebook - half HD screen, USB 2.0, processor and 2 GB of RAM do not scream at you high value. The screen is not very bright, and the contrast is quite low - everything looks washed out and bluish, compared to the same picture viewed on a higher end display. The sound is quiet and tinny. There is a wide rim all around the screen, which makes the wonder why are you carrying something that is bigger than it has to be. The unlighted keyboard is nice, and the touchpad seem to work good. It does understand gestures. It weighs 3.8 lbs, not 5.2 as listed on the product page. Dimensions are 0.70 in (H) x 13.54 in (W) x 9.45 in (D). I think they listed the box weight and size in the product description by accident.It is very easy to set up, simply choose wifi network and sign in into your google account. It was actually scary to see all my browser extensions and passwords working on the brand new computer that I only got out of the box couple of minutes ago. Guess I should have realized that it keeps passwords on the cloud. To sign in, you always have to type your google password, unless you enable smartlock - that is when you unlock it with a smartphone. The smartlock does not work half of the time even when the phone is right next to it.It is OK laptop to watch movies or browse the net, but it is not really powerful enough to do much more, not that you can run any programs on it anyway.
