Unhappy with my purchase
I own this computer and I wish I had not purchased it.  I have never owned another brand in the 20+ years of owning a PC.  I have never regretted owning a PC as much as I regret this purchase.  I might have just gotten a "lemon," but my experience has been terrible.  The computer will not see my WiFi network, I have to reboot and then it goes into a black screen saying no operating system and then I restart it and then it sees my WiFi.  So sure it is speedy but I have to do this EVERYTIME it goes to sleep.  A major pain.  I have spent hours on the phone with Dell over this situation.  I am one very unhappy customer.
