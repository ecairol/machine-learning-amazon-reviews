Screen Has Totally Washed Out Colors
So this little guy is pretty quick and very lightweight. I like that about it. The keyboard is easy to use. The track pad is responsive.My major problem with it is that the colors are SO WASHED OUT. All blacks look grey. And anything in grey is almost impossible to see. I'm used to my MacBook Pro - but this is pretty bad. I don't seem to notice it as much with TV shows. But when surfing the internet - it's almost always bugging me. Changing the angle of the screen only helps so much . I don't if they're all like this or if mine is an exception.If it weren't for that, I'd be in love with this little machine. Perfect for traveling. The charger is also very small and compact!
