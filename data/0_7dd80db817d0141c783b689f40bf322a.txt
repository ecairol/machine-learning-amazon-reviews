Not For Use on the Internet
Ok I am not a techie person.  I just expect that when I buy a new computer that it works for basic things like Facebook, email and poking around on the internet.  This computer doesn't do that.  When connecting to the internet it bogs down (I have installed 3 programs; Chrome, Open Office and Thunderbird) and locks up.  I have to restart the thing 3x a day.  I looked at the processes running and they mostly seem to be Windows, only one program, Chrome, running and it takes forever.  I have a Windows phone and have always used Windows, but this computer seems to hate it.  Every Windows update requires a full system refresh, which means you lose pretty much everything.  It hates my wireless, half the time it connects the other half it doesn't.It does bring up programs pretty fast and Open Office does work well on it from the little I have used it.Overall, I really do not like it and wish I had spent more and gone with something else.  I just thought that with the little I do that this could have, should have, done the job.
