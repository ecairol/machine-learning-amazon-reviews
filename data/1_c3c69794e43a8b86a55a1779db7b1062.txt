Details on what has improved since 3rd generation.
This was replacing a 16gb wifi ipad 3. Here are the things that have changed and that prompt a 5 star review -a) Obviously its much lighter, I can easily hold this with one hand and watch youtube for hours on end.b) The speaker is louder, so much louder thats formidable now, there are stereo speakers, eseentially means two speakers creating a good balance and overall worthwhile experience. On 80% volume you are left with loudness.c) This is not only much faster but the battery takes a flat 4 hours to charge from 2% to 100%. The iPad 3 takes more than double that time to fully charge. The battery is much better and remains consistent even though its been 2 months since 1st day.e) The camera both front/back have improvedThings I don't love -a) Safari - It is boring and needs a breath of fresh airb) Typing on this is better than previous generations but still a major painc) The camera location is not ideal since sometimes your hands will get in the middle of the lens and the thing you are trying to capture.d) The back build quality feels like its gonna break very easily, the buttons aren't as formidably built as the 3rd generation. I hope I am wrong but it will be an expensive lesson to learn.e) The headphone jack is not as loud as the 3rd generation, I almost want to hate it for that sole reason.Why I didn't buy the 3G model -a) I don't travel much and wherever I travel I find Wifi. In a worst case scneario I shall use a portable hotspot from my phone.b) It is much more pricy, who needs an extra monthly bill to add to all that i already haveSo there you have it.This is a device more perfect than my iPhone to be honest but I can't wait for more software features with respect to making iBooks more fun. I read on this ipad and watch youtube on it. Youtube on the ipad is better than your computer or cell phone plus its very loud so yes...
