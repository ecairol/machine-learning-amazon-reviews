I ordered this computer and it came on time but it was not packaged very good.  I opened it and it was okay.  The reason I am disappointed in this computer is that the keyboard was suppose to be lit and it did not light up.  I called Lenovo and there was nothing they could do. They told me to ship it back to Amazon for a refund.  I am now very unsure about Lenovo products, and I will probably not order another Lenovo product.
