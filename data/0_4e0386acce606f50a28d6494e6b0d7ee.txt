Grrrr Trackpad
Trying to type this is a challenge because the trackpad on my Dell XPS 13 keeps randomly jumping  back and forth in my text everytime I hit the space bar. I've had it a month but still not used to it - really slows me down.  Often whole lines are highlighted and deleted or overtyped. Only solution is to plug in external mouse and keyboard.So frustrating, and to think I nagged our IT department into letting me get this one (we have exclusive dell environment - but usually they supply Lattitudes).Other cons the battery doesn't last as long as my personal asus zenbook (over a year old now), and of course storage memory isn't that much  (especially since exchange server outlook 13 search function sucks - would like to be able to store more of my archives in machine). Then yesterday computer just shut down (still had half battery remaining), losing all unsaved changes to a word document I was working on, as well as a draft email.Yes it is small and light, the screen goes to edge of machine, but if I could return I would.
