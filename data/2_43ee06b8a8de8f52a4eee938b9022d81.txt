Got one of these through work a week ago and I love it. It feels slightly lighter/ thinner than my coworker's macbook airs and almost as good of quality (all metal case) for half the price and on a windows platform. The solid state hard drive and 8 gigs make it great for normal internet browsing and office work. Only downside is it gets a little hot when you're doing heavy work/ video/ memory intensive work (there is no fan) but I've only noticed that once. If you are memory intensive - you may want to add on 4gb more. Not sure how windows 10 will deal with memory (hopefully better than windows 7/8 that takes like 3gbs of your memory doing nothing). Highly recommend.
