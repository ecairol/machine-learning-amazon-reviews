Cliche'd "Worth the price, but you got what you paid for"
Feels like a macbook, but a little different.Keyboard:Just like a keyboard you would use for PC without the windows key and capslock.Keys take more power to push down.Webcam:Has a good quality webcam, but no internal mic.Games:Can't play much with Chrome OS. You can go to the chrome web store to download some games. You can also download .swf files from Kongregate if you want to and play them offline.I tried download Ubuntu, but it did not work for me. If you can make Ubuntu work, you can download steam and play games, but I doubt it can run games at a smooth frame rate.Speakers:They are under the laptop on the bottom side. They're close to the user.Left Side Plugins:Charger, Micro SD , miniHDMI, and a single 3.5mm hole for headphones+mic (EX: apple earpods would work)There are no separate holes for headphones and mic.Right side plugins:2 USB 2.0 portsGreat for homework, as I am a garbage lord that plays too many videogames. I have a $1700 desktop in my basement that I use only on friday nights, Saturday, and Sunday for gaming. I use this laptop on weekdays.
