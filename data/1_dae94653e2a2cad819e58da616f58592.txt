Pros:-Fast start-up-Light weight-Not too priceyCons:-Track pad became unresponsive(Still currently unresponsive, using a mouse, for 4 days.)-After plugging in some speakers, laptop internal speakers are now unresponsive for two days.-Internet connection shows up as "Limited" at times and I would have to restart laptop.I have requested to return the laptop and after hours of research I ordered a Mac 15 inch 16GB ram. I will ship this laptop back when Mac arrives. I rated this product 3 stars because it might be that i received a damaged product and I was able to do some work at school for my finals. Other than that I would have loved this laptop if it wasn't for the cons.
