for the price its a fantastic buy. I'm using a samsung note 4 android phone so everything is synch with this chrome book. even my whatsapp accountmy kids steal my laptop all the time to watch youtube and play fritz online. this way they can each have one and it would be under my account so i have control over their online activities.also, great for traveling because of its size and weight and the battery last for days... awesome.im not too picky about picture quality and audio but i could see people might not be crazy about it.
