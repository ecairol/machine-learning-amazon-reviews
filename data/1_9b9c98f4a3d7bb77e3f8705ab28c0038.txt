you get what you pay for...
This is cheap both in construction and feel. They case is cheap plastic (I'm talking dollar store cheap). If u drop this thing you are screwed. The plastic is so thin and poorly put together That the case flexes when you press a key. They keyboard itself is just terrible to type on, the exception being the 10 key -which is very handy. Nothing about this notebook shouts quality. It has a 500GB hard drive but a chunk of that is bloated OS. The drive is split into two volumes so don't freak out if u only see 165GB when you power up. The other 250 is on D (Data) drive. What I will say about this netbook is out of the box, its fast. Opens apps easily and connecting to net is a snap. NOT a good choice for playing steam games, the dual core just can't handle it.  The speakers are the WORST I have ever heard (almost like a very cheap external speaker) and don't do justice to the sound chip. You are definitely going to want to use headphones with this notebook. For a simple notebook to write code or create documents, this will do. Any graphic work or games -Not a good choice.
