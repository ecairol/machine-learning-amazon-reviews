Irritated to say the least. With the internet stuff its fine. But it doesnt have a disc drive on the side.. Okay my poor judgement in not reading. But even when buying an external dvd player and plugging it into the side, i cant watch movies! Is there seriously not a way to watch dvds on this laptop? Windows media player pretends theres nothing on the DVD! Thats about half of my use for this computer!
