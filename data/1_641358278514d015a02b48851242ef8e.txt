Good and bad. Runs great for the price...with minor problems.
I've had this for a long time now, over 6 months. It's a love/hate relationship, but that's to be expected with a computer that only weighs a couple pounds and runs for up to 4 hours (if you're REALLY miserly) on a charge. It's my travel laptop and for that it's fabulous!Runs everything I can throw at it. Windows 8.1 is a pain, but that's not Lenovo's fault. Yes, it's slow compared to other laptops but WAY faster than my eeePC was. It's for travel and on the go.Problems. Had to send it back to be refurbished after 1 month. Touchpad button stopped working. Still has problems charging fully, even though I've got it set to charge to 100%, I usually have to unplug it and plug it back in to go all the way. And the battery runs out even when "shut down" and sitting there. Has to be recharged every day. I suspect it runs even when off, don't know why. Lenovo's support was great, that's why they get the 3rd star.I would NOT buy this one again, as it's too problematic. But it's damn cheap for what you get.
