Be very careful about getting a refurbished one
Nice little computer, although my refurbished one showed up with Rocket Tabs malware and adware that hijacked my internet settings. Unfortunately, no matter what I did I was unable to get it to be able to connect to the internet. These days if you can't connect you can't get anything to work, or to get help. So it's going back and I'll get another one. This time it won't be refurbished!
