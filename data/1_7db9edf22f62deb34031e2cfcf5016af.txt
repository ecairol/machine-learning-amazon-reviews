Perfect for Students
I really, really like this product, but there are a few drawbacks worth nothing.First of all, the image and sound quality is pretty poor. The speakers are so bad that you'll likely need to put subtitles on or switch to headphones if there's a fan on in the room. When it comes to web browsing or working on something in google drive, the screen is sharp, crisp, and has a pretty high resolution. The problem is that it is not at all suitable for high-quality image editing, nor is it ideal for streaming videos. The contrast just isn't there.The other thing that I've noticed, though it probably only affects fellow insomniacs, is that the keyboard is not back lit. I didn't even think about this feature after using mac books for so long, but now that I don't have it, it's sorely missed. Typing in the dark is not really an option with this model.But yeah, as long as you're not using it primarily for media work, or a photo-phobic vampire, this thing is perfect. It's light, inexpensive, features a well designed body as well as interface, and comes with a ton of google drive storage. The red is vibrant, but not garish.
