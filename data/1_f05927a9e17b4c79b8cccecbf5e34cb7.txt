I like the Chromebook concept
Had this Chromebook for about a week now.The pros:Very good battery lifeVery quick boot upGood speakers and keyboard (for the cost of the machine)Nice exterior stylingTouchpad good once I got used to itLightweightNo noise and very little heatNo crapware bogging down the operating systemCostThe cons:Screen is just OK.  Seems like something on a laptop from 10-15 years ago.Bezel and area around keyboard are a bit excessive - the overall dimensions could be a bit smallerWould like a mini-USB port for chargingNo backlit keys (probably asking for too much in this price range.)No ability to upgrade the RAM or replace the battery.So far it's been fairly responsive with whatever I've done, although I haven't really run anything too demanding.I'd probably give it 5 stars by just improving the display screen.
