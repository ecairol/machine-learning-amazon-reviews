The packaging was the only thing that made me nervous! It seemed like the outter box it was in didn't have much protection. Very little paper inside for protection. But the actual box for the computer seemed sturdy. It arrived on time and I've been happy with the computer! Works well for my light gaming. Runs LoL pretty well on default settings. I've never had the computer freeze up on me. I'm happy in general just wish it had more memory
