Glad this thing comes with Windows 7
Just got this thing unpacked. Maybe its because this is a new laptop for me but so far I am not as impressed as I hoped to be. Still for only $300 bucks I guess I shouldn't complain too much. Glad this thing comes with Windows 7. No, DVD/CD player is a little weird. Especially because it came with all the backup CDs and what not. If I change my mind about anything I'll update my post.
