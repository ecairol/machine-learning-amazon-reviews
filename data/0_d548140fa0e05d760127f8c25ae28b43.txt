DON'T BE FOOLED BY "GOOD" PRICE
I have had this computer for exactly 1 year 10 days now and it has died on me twice now (wont power on). The price may be decent for someone who just wants to check email or browse every once in a while, but trust me, this computer is not worth half the money it costs. If you plan on  purchasing this computer make sure you get an extended warranty if you want your 500 dollars to last more than a year, because after their warranty if over you are SOL. And don't buy their warranty buy from someone else like Geek Squad. Lenovo doesn't deserve any more money for their junk of a product.
