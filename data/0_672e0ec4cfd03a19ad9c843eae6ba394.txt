I bought this chromebook with the intent of being able to use it at school and at home for writing and assignments. I really liked it; the only issue I had was it being a little slow sometimes. About 4 months after I bought it however, the entire bottom half of my keyboard stopped working. It has never been dropped or had any sort of water damage. I would not recommend this to anyone.
