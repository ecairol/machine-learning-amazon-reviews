poor quality control.
I recently purchased this unit from Amazon. It arrived very quickly. First problem I had was with the WiFi. It would not stay connected. So I returned it for an exchange in hopes of getting a solid unit. Well I received this one today, and guess what.. the damn remote is defective. One side of the remote only half the buttons work, but the touchpad does not. And on the keyboard side, nothing works!!! So during initial setup I cant input any letters.. so no setup. A workaround is to plug the unit directly into ethernet to get a direct internet connection, then you can download Google tv remote on the Google app store and then you can use your Google device (mines a Nexus 7 tablet) to control it. Back to Amazon with this one.. last time I'm going to exchange.. if I get another bad unit, I give up.
