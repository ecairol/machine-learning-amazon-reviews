This is the most useless piece of equipment you could ever purchase if you use products that require windows software...and mst do... there are videos on changing it over but you risk losing all of your money and completely void your warranty by trying them. If you plan to do nothing but write notes and papers and access the internet occasionally I guess it can work but if you are a gamer or plan to use anything high tech with this..get an HP
