Uggg.  What a pain.
Remote works intermittently.  It can't find a match for my Hopper 2000 on Dish Network so it can't control my TV.  And visiting download speed test website pretty much hung it up in flash compatibly land.Pretty much everything I tried to do with it was frustrating and time consuming.  The revue was WAAAAAAAY more responsive and easy to set up.I've contacted tech support but my day 2 opinion of it is it is pretty much unfinished and buggy as hell.  The IR blaster is a joke...I had to swap batteries 3 times before I realized it's good old fashioned patchy performance.
