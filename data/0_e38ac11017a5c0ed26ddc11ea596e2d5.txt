One Star
Not what I expected. There was no optical drive. Also I did not like the mouse pad. It was very stiff & after using it for a half hour my fingers were hurting from having to press so hard scrolling. It was however better than other Notebooks I have used. Very user friendly & fairly quick. If you dont mind the above problems I listed you might really like it.
