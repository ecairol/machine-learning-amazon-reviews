I just received the computer 1 day ago and the "esc" key felt apart. A very tiny pin located on the holding frame broken. Considering that it is a very short time using it and a very little used key i'm very concerned about the quality of the keyboard. This my 7th laptop and it never happened to me before.The other concern is about bluetooth availability to connect to android devices. It was imposible to connect to my samsung s4 mini, due to and error after receiving the number confirmation.Would i recomended, i dont think so!
