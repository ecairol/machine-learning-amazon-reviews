Just OK
This computer is certainly functional, and does everything I need it to but the case is very cheaply made.  The fingered mouse is also a bit sloppy.  It was a great price and certainly a good option for a desk/not portable computer with the added mouse.  Im using it mostly for e-mail at this point.  Cheaper than an iPad!
