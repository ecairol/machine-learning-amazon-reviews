iPad Air was a great buy!  You won't regret it!
Purchased this at a recently run promo at the local Best Buy ($150 in gift cards that I received for the purchase was promptly used to offset it's higher cost).It is a 5-star tablet in everyway.  I'm fully invested in Amazon media and am glad that Amazon saw fit to put all it's services onto the iPad Air via apps so that I can access it seamlessly.  I have both the HDX 8.9 and the Air even though the HDX 8.9 has a better screen, I prefer reading books and magazines on the iPad Air because of the 4:3 aspect ratio.  I also am happy that I got it because it is apparently the only tablet that works on my company's internal network.The HDX 8.9 is better for video watching, particularly if you're watching without headphones.  The speakers on it are amazing.  However, the speakers on the Air aren't bad, they're  just too close together to practically be stereo.That said, both the HDX 8.9 and the Air are 5-star tablets.  They have different strengths and do different things well.  The HDX 8.9 is now my son's and the iPad Air is mine (because of it's work functionality).You really can't go wrong with either tablet.
