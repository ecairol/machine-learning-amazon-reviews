Loved My Yoga Til On Button Broke
Bought my Lenovo Yoga 2 11 four months ago and was very satisfied with it. Unfortunately, my power button will no longer turn the unit on or off. If the unit shuts down the only way to turn it on is the NOVO button which should only be used by advanced operators. When something as necessary as the ON button breaks I don't think that's a good sign of a quality piece of equipment. Lenovo says they'll fix it because it's still under warranty but I have to send it to them and that means weeks, possibly months (if the parts are not available) without my computer. And the whole time I am without my computer, the term of the warranty just keeps ticking away a fact confirmed by the person I spoke with in support. According to this same person, I could take it back to Best Buy and have the Geek Squad fix it at my expense. If Geek Squad can do the repair at the place where I bought my unit, why all the shipping? If the local bricks-and-mortar store where I bought my still-under-warranty Yoga 2 11 can repair it, then I should be able to take it there and have it repaired. I cannot recommend the Lenovo Yoga 2 11 because  the on button breaks too easily and the Lenovo warranty terms are ridiculous.
