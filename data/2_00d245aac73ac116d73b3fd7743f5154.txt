Battery life a bit disappointing
Battery life is nowhere near the 10 hours claimed, not that I really expected that long (battery life is a lot like EPA mileage estimates).  But the first couple of charges were down in the 3 to 4 hour range, not much more than the UX31A this replaced.  Recent charges are more in the 5+ hour range, which is about double the UX31A was giving me.  It is slower than the UX31A, for most things that isn't a big deal but I have noticed it when I'm doing software development and have a number of applications open.  The cover scratched the first trip out, something I hadn't seen on previous UX computers. I didn't think I'd miss the backlit keyboard, but I find I do.  Then again, this computer travels really well given its light weight and thin.
