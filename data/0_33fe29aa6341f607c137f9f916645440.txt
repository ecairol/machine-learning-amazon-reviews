Sometimes Zenbook worked fine, so I kept it until today
A few days later I received the Zenbook, there was a display issue.  The screen turned to black, everything stops for a min and turns back on the display.  I thought it was not going to be a big issue.  However, only a month later I bought this Zenbook, I have only used Zenbook for my school, the screen would not turn on.  The power button light was on, but nothing was displaying on it.  Sometimes Zenbook worked fine, so I kept it until today.  However, three days ago, my Zenbook's screen would not turn on at all! I contacted Asus service for a repair and now I am sending it to the repair center.  If I knew I was going to have a this big problem, I would have returned it before return policy ended.
