and I've been in love ever since
My UX305FA came in the mail a week ago, and I've been in love ever since. I was just comparing it to the MacBook Air 13.3" and this baby pretty much kicks its butt especially for the price, and don't get me wrong I'm not an Apple hater one bit.Quick list of pro's and cons.PROS: It's SOOO light and slim! design is beautiful. witch was really important to me  Battery life pretty bomb(as in good), can be on solid from 9-4 with no complaints.  Windows 10 looks and runs great on it.  It is fast. not insanely fast, but the perfect speed for the average Jo I'd say.  Probably more but I said I'd be quick  oh the smart gestures on the touch pad are sooo handy btwCONS: No backlit key board.(I say this because I really wanted one, but if you press fn+a the screen brightens up and is a good substitute. and I'm writing this in a dark room so its not bad)  Windows 10 was really easy to install, but was a bit jumbled for a bit afterword, I had to repair some program drivers and little things. It was worth it though.  honestly Idk if its my headphones or the computer... but they don't get along great for some reason and it makes me mad sometimes.I think that's all. Overall I'm sooo happy with my buy. And I sure hope it lasts until I die. lol Hope this helped you out.
