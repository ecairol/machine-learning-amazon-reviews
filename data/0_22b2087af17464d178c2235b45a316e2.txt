Don't Buy
It was nice while it lasted but now after 15 months it has become unusable. All it does is flash the Chrome logo on and off. It will nor let me log in or anything. I tried all the fixes on the internet I could find, nothing worked. Now Asus told me they can fix it but it will cost at least $300. Are they kidding. Then he have the nerve to ask me if I want to do a survey on the my Asus experiance. LOL.
