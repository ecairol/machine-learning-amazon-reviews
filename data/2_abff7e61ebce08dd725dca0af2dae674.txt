Great Chromebook for a great price
Let me say this, understand what you are buying before you buy it! I notice a lot of other reviews saying this is not what they expected. Now moving on, I love my Chromebook. It is easy to carry and light weight but not cheap. It has super fast boot up and connection as well as great response time. I like that all of my docs are saved to my Google Drive and can be accessed anywhere. The Chrome OS does not leave room for downloads or off line work so understand that gaming, and Microsoft Office are not an option on this. You can use Microsoft online however. This is not a problem for me, but if you need Windows this is not the laptop for you. The screen shows my movies awesomely and I was able to flawlessly Chromecast to my Smart TV. I love every inch of this little laptop, however I could only give it 4 stars for one big reason. I am pretty tech savvy, but it took me and my husband about an hour to figure out how to print and another hour setting up the printer. It really bummed me out that I could not simply hook the printer up to the computer. If you don't care about the printing aspect then this laptop gets 5 stars but for me it lost points for this. All in all, know what you're buying. For what it is made for it is about perfect, but do not expect this to completely replace your Windows computers.
