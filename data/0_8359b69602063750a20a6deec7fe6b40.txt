The wireless connectivity on this doesn't work correctly.  I've ran every online troubleshoot but it always says "Download Not Available".  Confirmed all other machines in the house can connect fine.  The support team at Vizio led by "Bently" was worthless and could not offer any help.  Better off getting a better quality tv for smart app functionality.
