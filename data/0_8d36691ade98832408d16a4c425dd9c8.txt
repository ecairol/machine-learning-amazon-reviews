SUPER annoying, and was not expecting that
Worrrsssst laptop ever!No CAPS button, just a search button? As if I couldn't type directly into the search bar in the engine?No alt+reblog for tumblr, which is what I basically bought a computer for, was blogging.No CD or DVD rom at all! SUPER annoying, and was not expecting that.Very basic laptop. I feel like a kid that gets a simplified-for-children iPad. Absolutely NOT what I was expecting.Will be buying a different laptop and selling this one.
