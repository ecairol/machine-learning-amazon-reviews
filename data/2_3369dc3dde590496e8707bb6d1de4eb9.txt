C300 for Linux??
The Asus C300 is pleasing to use and a good value alternative.  I had wanted a MacBook Air, but had not wanted to pay a large sum for a relatively poor screen.  Quite a few people have reviewed the Asus C300.  I'll therefore be selective in my review.I loaded Crouton onto the Chromebook and installed Ubuntu.  With Ubuntu the Chromebook functions just fine.  I have not found the 2 GB ram to be a limitation.  Right now I am typing with 6 browser tabs and 3 applications open.  I am quickly running out of hard drive memory and will need to purchase a card to supplement it.Currently I am using my Asus C300 to practice developing in Python.  As mentioned before, Linux runs well and overall I am pleased.
