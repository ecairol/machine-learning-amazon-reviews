I was hesitant to buy this laptop after reading reviews about its faulty problems of crushing. switching off or not charging. But my daughter was so adamant that I decided to buy.  The master board crashed after five months of usage. I am struggling to get a refund or repair from Lenova as the deadlinefor refund from Amazon was after one month from date of purchase.  This is the last time I will ever buy an electronic through Amazon, I will buy from DEALERS only.
