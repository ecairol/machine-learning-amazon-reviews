I finally had the opportunity to replace my lap top thanks to my amazing boyfriend. This computer is super fast and great for a light user like me. I only need a laptop for papers and Facebook. The only thing I would complain about is a pretty awful track pad and the laptop itself is fairly cheap. However, it is very lightweight and I still love it.
