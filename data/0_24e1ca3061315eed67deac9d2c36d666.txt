Too many defects
Don't purchase this laptop. This laptop does not have the specs I hoped for but anyways, I'll get to that later.I usually don't do reviews, but this product + Amazon support has put through a lot of frustration that  I decided to write an HONEST review about this product.Had I paid more attention to the specs, I wouldn't have purchased this product in the first place.This laptop is the "UX305fa" model. There is another one that costs $50 more on amazon that is the "ux305la" model. For $50 more, you get an intel processor that is much better than the "Core M"The Latest Intel processors go from best to least best in the following chronological order:Intel I7, Intel I5 (This is what the UX305LA has), Intel I3, and the M core (What the UX305FA currently has). So hopefully this will convince you to add $50 more to get a processor that is WAY BETTER than that "FA" model.Ok so the Pros/cons:Pros:Thin: Makes it very easy to carry around, especially since I am a college student.Battery Life: Works wonderful.Storage is of plentyDisplay is amazingCons:-Trackpad is noisy and sometimes clumsy. I use a logitech remote bluetooth mouse to solve the issue.-USB port does not recognize devices. Connects/disconnects simultaneously. This is an issue that other have experienced as well. There are 3 usb 3.0 drives: two on the left and one on the right. The one on the right fails to work properly. The other two cause more issue because they do not allow file transfer properly. I send a file over and it says USB device is disconnected.-No backlit keyboard. C'mon, for this price a back-lit keyboard is a must.-Windows 10 has been causing graphics driver crashed when not plugged in charging. I updated the driver and hope that this issue has been resolved.Overall, this laptop is convenient if it didn't have so many defects. I honestly suggest everyone look into the "LA" model, since it has better specs for only $50 more.
