Enjoyable, solid performance in a durable, portable package
The ASUS Zenbook UX305LA is an outstanding small laptop; it was good with Windows 10, but even better once I installed Windows 7 Home Premium. I wouldn't recommend it for hardcore gaming, video editing, or scientific computing, but for day to day uses such as email, web browsing, office work, and media playing, it really is a solid performer.
