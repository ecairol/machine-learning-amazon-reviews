Install crouton, run Linux, forget the ChromeOS Limitations
Paid $150 for this thing and it way exceeds my expectations.  Here is the catch.  You have to install crouton and put a flavor of linux on it.  It's not hard, just follow the basic instructions that can be found with a simple google search for chromebook crouton.  Once you have a linux distro running on this a lot of those questions I see that are answered NO, become YES.  Yes, it will run Minecraft.  Yes, it will run a full office suite (Libre Office).  Yes, you can hookup an external CD Rom.  This thing is fantastic!!!! and is everything a Netbook should have been.  Oh yeah, and it also runs ChromeOS, but I am not sure what you would use this for.
