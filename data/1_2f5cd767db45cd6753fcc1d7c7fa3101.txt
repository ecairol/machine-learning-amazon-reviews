I like the feel of it (lightweight)
As far as I can determine, the Toshiba Satellite laptop can do everything an HP can do. I like the feel of it (lightweight).The keyboard is easy to type on. The only complaint on the keyboard is that the letter o and the number 0 are confusing me, and when I try to hit the shift, I end up hitting the control key. This is probably something I have to get used to with my typing skills. Like I said, I'm very satisfied with my Toshiba Satellite.Amazon Prime, as usual, was perfect in their delivery. :-)
