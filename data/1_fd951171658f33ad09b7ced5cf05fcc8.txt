Sound is just OK
This was a good purchase overall. My only complaint being the disappointing sound quality. I am disappointed because the sound does not live up to the SonicMaster hype in the description on the Amazon and Asus websites. Had I not fallen for their bull, I would have bought the Acer laptop which has more features for the same price.
