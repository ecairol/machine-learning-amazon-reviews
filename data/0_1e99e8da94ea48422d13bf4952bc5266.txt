they would have to pay me to take this again
I've had this for a few days now and I've got to say this is the worst laptop I've ever had. I got it refurbished and the first thing it had to do was restart and update. The was 160 updates and it was going really slow before finally just stopping on 58. I left it for 2 hours thinking it would just take time and it stayed on 58. I finally had to turn it off and turn it back on which took a long time. Now that I am actually able to use it it is really slow and the internet pages sometimes just stop working completely. Also the quality of the laptop itself is poor. It feels like flimsy plastic. Piece of sh*t
