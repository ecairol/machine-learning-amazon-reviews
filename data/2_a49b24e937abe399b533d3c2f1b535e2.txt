Nice little unit -except for some keyboard issues
Has been a great little device, but the mouse keys started not working and driving my husband nuts.  Wound up replacing it with a different model.  Everything else worked great and we are not tossing it - just will add a physical mouse and use it in my husband's shop / office.
