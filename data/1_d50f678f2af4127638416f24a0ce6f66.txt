Good, but not great. Again, you get what you pay for.
It's okay if you don't play any normal games. It barely runs minecraft and won't run many other games my son would like to play. My son wanted to video capture of his xbox 360 but it couldn't really do that. The video card can't handle it. If you want it to browse the internet and do educational things it's not that bad of a computer. But, just know what you're getting in to.
