Disappointing
Make no mistake: this is a cheap computer. It looks cheap, it feels cheap. There are no indicator lights for the caps lock, number lock and scroll lock functions. This is annoying, but it's acceptable: it's a cheap computer.What's unacceptable is the computer's inability to do anything with my smart phone. It won't charge, it won't exchange data. It just rapidly connects and disconnects, several times a second. This is actually more irritating than if it did nothing at all.I've thought a lot about whether it's fair to factor in the OS in this review. After all, the people at ASUS didn't design Windows 8.1, and they may not have even had much choice in whether or not it got used in this model. I don't know. I do know that Windows 8.1 is a terrible OS for a non-touch laptop PC, even when it's used in its "desktop" mode. I don't know who made that final decision to ship this PC with Windows 8.1, but that was a bad decision, and I hope that person realizes that he or she has made the world a worse place.In summary, I am mildly dissatisfied. I've definitely purchased better PCs in this price range. But it's mostly functional, and at least I didn't pay a thousand dollars for it.
