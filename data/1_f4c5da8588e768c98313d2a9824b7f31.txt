No CD/DVD Drive!!!!
This laptop does not have a CD/DVD drive! I did not look for that in the specifics because I thought every full-size laptop had it. Apparently not! It runs and works well enough so far in other respects, but that was a big let-down. Since I think every laptop ought to have the CD/DVD drive, I can only rate it as ok.
