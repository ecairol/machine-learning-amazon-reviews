After installing MS Office (not included with the purchase) it is uber awesome. Love the touch screen
I just bought this lenovo as a black friday deal. After installing MS Office (not included with the purchase) it is uber awesome. Love the touch screen, tablet mode and the fact that it has a motion sensor. I previously had a Dell inspiron 15.6". This little thing is freaking amazing, portable and exceptionally convenient.
