Perfect PC - No Reservations Whatsoever
I love this laptop.  Stylish.  Beautiful screen.  Nice chiclet-style keyboard.  Blazingly fast. Absolutely zero complaints.  Love everything about it!  Full disclosure:  I buy everything from Amazon.com, but for this purchase I bought it from the Microsoft store for $100 less due to a "student grad" discount.  MS also bundled the software "bloat free," however that didn't matter to me.  When I unpacked the PC, I never booted it to Windows.  Before I turned it on, I stuck a USB stick in with Ubuntu 14.04 on it, reformatted the hard drive and laid Ubuntu down as the o/s.  This PC makes child's play of Ubuntu... zero issues... and crazy fast.  I am not a gamer, so I can't speak to performance in that regard.  I am also a wireless mouse user, so the fact that others have found the track pad to be an annoyance is something I cannot speak to.  What I can say is this:  I would recommend this machine without reservations.Wanted to add these additional comments:1) My review is based on three weeks of rigorous use.2) I have had zero issues with the display driver... no crashes... I wonder if the issue is with Windows?  I am running Ubuntu 14.04.
