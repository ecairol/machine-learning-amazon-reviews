Logitech C920 vs C910 impressions
Film grain is very apparent on this webcam. Even in a well lit room, you can see the grains compared to the C910. Also, the focusing on this camera is worse than in the C910. On the C910, my room whole room would appear crisp and in focus.Mic still picks up too much background noise. The C910 wasn't any better in this regard. Disappointing that this isn't fixed on the C920 by at least increasing the resistance a little or have it done in software.It has come to my attention (from comments below) that this webcam actually has a 3 megapixel sensor and Logitech gets its 15 megapixels by using software! That explains the worse image quality.Pros: The C920 has a standard tripod mount. This is useful for mounting to mini-tripods that can be placed anywhere on your desk. On board video encoder means it will reduce CPU usage (but still wasn't enough to use on G+ Hangouts with anymore people in the room than with the C910 on a laptop running with AMD C-50, 2GB ram)Cons: Worse image quality than the C910. This might be due to the fact that it uses a 3 MP sensor versus the 5 MP on the C910. Tests were done subjectively in Skype, Google Hangouts, and from recorded video via Logitech's own software at 720P and 1080P. Running on an AMD 965 BE quad core 3.4 Ghz, 4 GB Ram, Windows 7 64 Bit. Honestly, its hard to tell if there's any CPU reduction on a desktop like mine since it doesn't tax my system enough.
