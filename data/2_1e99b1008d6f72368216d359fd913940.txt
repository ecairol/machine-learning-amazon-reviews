Amazing performance for the price- Runs Adobe Lightroom 5
I have had the laptop for a week and I am impressed. It is decently fast and easy to use for everyday stuff like web browsing, YouTube, email, Word, Excel, etc. The part that really impressed me is that I am actually able to run Adobe Lightroom 5 on this laptop surprisingly well. I am a beginner and only use it to edit a few photos on weekends but it runs with very little slowdown. I wouldn't recommend it to serious photographers due to the small hard drive and budget CPU but it does run Lightroom well enough to use lightly. The cons: it is built of somewhat cheap plastic, lightweight, easy to scratch and not very protective if the laptop were to be dropped. I would NOT recommend this laptop to anyone that is hard on their stuff.  It feels a bit cheap and fragile. There is no optical (CD/DVD) drive as every other review has already made clear. It can only hold 4 GB of RAM and the battery is internal, hard to replace for non- tech types. The CPU and graphics card will not run most games well, if at all. Overall this laptop is like a fuller featured netbook- made for light use for students or older adults on a budget who don't expect it to last for more than 2 or 3 years. It does everything a Chromebook does and more for the same price and I highly recommend it.
