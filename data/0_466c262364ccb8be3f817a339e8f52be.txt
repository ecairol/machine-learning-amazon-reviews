Not good for editing Google documents
I purchased this Laptop for a single reason and that was to edit a book I am writing in Google docs. It will not let me edit the entire Google document as when I get near the end of the doc the cursor places itself off of the doc and I can no longer edit. The typing also has a delay which is very distracting.All other things seem to work OK but not for a lot of editing in Google docs.
