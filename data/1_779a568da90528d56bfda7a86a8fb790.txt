Great Price
Got this while it was on sale. Great price and specs for a laptop that's on the cheaper end. It made for a great Christmas gift for my wife so she can upload and manager her music again. We haven't had any issues with it so far. There is a small added expense in buying an external DVD/CD drive, but even with that it's a great purchase.
