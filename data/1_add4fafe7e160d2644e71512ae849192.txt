great for my father in law
seems nice, got this for my father in law. It is zippy and a nice size. Not sure i see much benefit in getting 4gb ram so far, 2GB would have been fine also it seems. Did not see 13hr battery life yet but might need to adjust screen brightness to get that. Cant beat the price though, this feels better than the $200 i paid for it.
