My second ASUS, love the SSD
ASUS fortunately got rid of the poor rapid start feature.  This baby boots to the login screen in about 5 seconds and full windows in an additional 15 seconds, thanks to the SSD.  Battery life is excellent.  I go all day without charging.  The upgrade to W10 went without a hitch.  Make a recovery USB drive!  I tried installing AVG to replace my trial version of McAfee without uninstalling McAfee first and turned the Laptop into a vegetable.  The recovery drive saved the day.
