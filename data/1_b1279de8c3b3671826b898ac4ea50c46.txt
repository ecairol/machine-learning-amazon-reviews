If you've never used a Chrome operating system, be cautious.
I love how small and compact this thing is.I'm not a fan, AT ALL, of the Chrome OS. However, this is obviously not the unit or seller's fault. My wife and I wanted to try a Chromebook out to have something lightweight to carry around and do online college coursework, but the Chrome operating system is very difficult to learn, and we are both rather tech-savvy. If you're used to Microsoft, it's gonna take you some time to learn this thing.
