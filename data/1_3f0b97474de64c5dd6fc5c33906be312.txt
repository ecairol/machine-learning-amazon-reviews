good value, slight issue
I purchased this on a cyber Monday sale for around $160. I had been watching the price for about 6 months, and I am very pleased with the product at this price point. It boots extremely fast and the battery lasts to my satisfaction. These were two important criteria for me as I wanted a laptop for impromptu, frequent writing and web browsing. While the case is light and aesthetically pleasing, the mousepad/trackpad is not securely anchored underneath. This leads to an occasional click not being registered, especially if it is pressed near the edge. I have used it almost every day for two weeks, and it has made a noticeable difference in my productivity.
