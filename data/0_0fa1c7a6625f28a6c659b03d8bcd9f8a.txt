Really nice design, works great when its plugged in
I just purchased this machine and love the look and feel.  It works great when I am working on AC power.  When i unplug the machine and work off of battery power, the machine slows to a crawl.  Web browsing is impossible and everything takes minutes to open.  ASUS tech support is useless.  I have refreshed the machine, installed all the updates and re-installed windows to no avail.I dont know if others experience the same issues but I am hoping its this machine.
