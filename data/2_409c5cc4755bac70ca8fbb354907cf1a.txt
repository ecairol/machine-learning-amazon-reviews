It's a great little notebook for those on a budget
It's a great little notebook for those on a budget. My 13 year old daughter loves . I bought it just to see if she could take care of it for a year and I'll upgrade her to a laptop. I messed with it and the functionality once you get used to it is great. Would recommend as a starter but not for high school age kids.
