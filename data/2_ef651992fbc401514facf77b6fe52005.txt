Excellent Computer
Pros:1.Thinness and weight. This thing isn't much heavier than carrying an actual notebook around. The kind with paper in them. I slide it into my computer bag, and secure it with the velcro strap and almost feels like the bag is empty. Everyone I've shown this too has marveled at its slim design.2. Great keyboard. As an author, this was extremely important to me. I can type on this all day long! I make fewer typos too. Always a plus, and when I do make an error, it's not a stretch to the backspace key to fix it. A lighted one would be nice though, but there are decent sized raised ridges on the J and F keys making it easy to feel where my hands are.3. It's so much faster than the Acer Sleekbook I bought just three months before I bought this. Like night and day.4. It looks fantastic. I know, shouldn't really matter as looks don't help performance, but let's face it, looks do matter.5. Price--this is an outstanding laptop for the price. It looks, feels and performs like a premium computer, but costs hundreds less.Cons:1. the power pin could fit in more securely. Mine seems to be a little loose in when it's seating in the housing. (hole? whatever you call it where you plug it in to the computer.)2. I've had a few brief display driver fails. They fixed themselves each time, but it's startling when it does it, and makes me a bit nervous. I'm hoping there will be some kind of fix for that in an update.
