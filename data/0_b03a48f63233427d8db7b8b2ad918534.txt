Can't Rely on It to Keep Stay Connected
I gave it two stars because the price seemed good for a portable laptop. But those benefits are frequently moot because connectivity is so unreliable. I've yet to find any rhyme or reason to why it refuses to connect to new networks or suddenly drops known networks. I can't rely on it to keep me connected (whether wireless or ethernet). In addition, I've found the touchpad awkward. Also, I've had it for almost four months and am beginning to experience issues with the display - random parts of the screen black out from time to time.
