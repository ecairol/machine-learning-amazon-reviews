Slim and Sleek
This is a great investment for the price- having switched over from a similarly priced ACER I was shocked by quality of the machine. The hinges are wonderfully sturdy, the machine runs so quietly, and hardly heats up at all. its slim and sleek design looks and feels very well made, not plasticky at all. Best of all, is the screen/image quality. I don't think I've ever owned a screen this sharp, its a joy to use. I use my computer mainly for typing papers and found I really enjoy the responsive chiclet keyboard, the back lighting on it is an unexpectedly wonderful feature for evening use. While I mostly use this device as a laptop, for 3-d modeling and exploration of simulation I've found the touch screen gives really great interaction. This is also my new kindle reading device of choice- the large screen plus touch is great for reading pdf's etc. I have noted that the key's leave oil imprints on the screen from my fingers whne the laptop is closed- however this is easily remedied with a soft cloth. overall I am very pleased with my purchase- At the time of this review I will have been using this device for a week. l update this in 1-2 months with my feelings on the computer after some time has pased
