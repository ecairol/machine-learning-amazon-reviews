Horrible Experience
I purchased over 20 of these for digital advertising for my retail locations.  Over half have turned out to be defective, either DOA, through overheating after 1-2 months, or the remote would drop bluetooth signal and I would have to reset the whole unit (Yes that means reset factory mode) to get the bluetooth up and running. I have called in to have the units replaced and that was over 2 WEEKS AGO, they said they were sending me a RMA, no show.  The reason why they are selling for 79.99 is because it is a garbage product.  I have started to switch to Sony NSG or the Netgear Prime.  Both Sony and Netgear have 100x better service than Hisense, Netgear sent me a replacement unit right away.  Comparing it to the Netgear prime, the hisense is almost identical.  I have had 5 Netgear units running and 8 Sony units and have not had single problem with either or.  I purchased more Hisense because of the price and surely regret it!!UPDATE*** AS OF SEPTEMBER 13thMany of the units have continued to break down due to the same issue either overheating or bluetooth remote not working.  Out of 20 units I only have 6 left that are actually working.  HISENSE HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE I HAVE SEEN IN 20 YEARS OF BUYING ELECTRONICS, they are a bunch of liars, they have the slowest services, and have yet to get back to me about any of the units I had submitted for repair.  I have reported them to the BBB!!!!PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, DO NOT WAIST YOUR TIME, I PROMISE YOU THIS PRODUCT WILL OVERHEAT AND STOP WORKING IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  I have switched to buy the Sony NSZ, I know its a little bit more but its better to spend 50 dollars more than to throw away 100$.  My guess is this is the reason Amazon has been selling them for 79.99, why else would they drop the price to just about cost if the product was so good.
