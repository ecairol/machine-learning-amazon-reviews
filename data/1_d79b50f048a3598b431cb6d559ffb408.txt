Buy chromebook, use internet
If you want a simple machine that will browse the web with ease, you've found it. I was in the market for something light, compact, and that turned on quickly. I have a bigger, older laptop that works OK, but I don't need to work in Excel or Adobe every night, I just wanted to put my feet up and hop on the internet. That's exactly what this Chromebook is. I chose this one for a few reasons, but mainly for the price. There were some cheaper options, like the super popular Acer model, but this one simply looked the nicest. It's also one of the lighter options, which after carrying around a 4.5 pound Dell for three years was very appealing. Despite being very light -- seriously, it feels like a slightly heavier frisbee -- it doesn't feel cheap. It's made with a smooth, hard plastic that doesn't show finger prints, and the dark blue color hides dust/dirt well. The track pad is about average, as is the keyboard. I honestly have no complaints about this laptop at all -- it's exactly what I expected. But that's also why I gave it just 4 stars. Nothing surprised me or blew me away. Chromebooks as a rule won't really surpass expectations since they're made to be very simple, and this model is certainly no different. I got the 2GB model, which is a little slow at times, and the speakers leave something to be desired. But if you're like me and just want something easy to play around on the internet, this laptop will do the trick.
