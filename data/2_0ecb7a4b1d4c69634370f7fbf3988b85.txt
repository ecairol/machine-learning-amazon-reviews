A Mix of Pros and Cons
Don't get me wrong, this laptop is really good. It's very simple and to the point but don't expect to download everything you want. I thought I could download a good video editing program for my YouTube videos onto this laptop but there's not one super reliable program. Can't download Minecraft. Bummer! I can't even figure out how to use the camera to record video.A lot of the apps are not really apps but links to websites. Okay, I'm saying a lot of bad things here but you have to remember this is not a windows laptop.. It's a chrome and if your using it to browse the Internet for work, business or just for fun by all means get this thing! It's a perfect size and has a beautiful screen.It suits my simple needs but I find myself using my windows computer to do more video stuff which is what I didn't want to do.
