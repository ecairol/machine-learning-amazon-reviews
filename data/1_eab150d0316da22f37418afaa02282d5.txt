Ok...but with little issues.
This (so far) seems like a good deal.However....IIve had this laptop for 2 weeks & its now taking up to an entire minute to show the screen after I login. Odd. Mostly because my daughter (with restrictions set) never has this problem. My virus software says I'm ok, so I'm contacting Asus today.
