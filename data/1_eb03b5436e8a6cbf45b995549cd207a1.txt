Lenovo Yoga 2 11, great PC, but crappy WIFI card.
I purchased this laptop at Best Buy back in April and can say that there is one glaring problem, the wifi. The pre-installed mini wifi card from Lenovo is by far the slowest piece of junk that I have ever had the displeasure of working with. I recently purchased an Intel AC 7260 mini card to attempt to swap out the old sluggish card. However I discovered Lenovo has rigged this PC to only work with the crappy wifi card they installed otherwise known as "whitelisting". From what I have researched online this is basically just a ploy to get more laptop sales or to get you to buy newer, more advanced laptops.There are ways to bypass the problem with the wifi card lockdown but they involve installing modified code into the BIOS which you could potentially brick a computer. I have an ASUS RT AC668U and con only get a top speed of 74 mbps from the current wifi card.Other than my rant above I really like this laptop. It does come pre-installed with bloatware from Lenovo which you can uninstall as needed. The PC is a great entry/budget laptop for users that don't need high bandwidth like gaming or streaming HD movies, but its great for web browsing.I'll update this review if Lenovo ever fixes the problem but doubtful.
