Buy if on budget, save for a little better, good make by lenovo though.
I bought from bestbuy i love typing on it! i use for school, code, my buisness diffrent things. The bettary life could be better, but it works. I do think because of my situation i should have gotten at least the i3 processor version. I do reccomend. BTW you will never use this as a tablet but will use stand mode a lot!
