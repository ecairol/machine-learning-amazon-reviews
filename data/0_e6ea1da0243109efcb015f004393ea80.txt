Vizio has let me down
Bought the TV because for the best features in the price point ($314.99+tax from Best Buy). Looks great, and picture quality is quite good. However, there's a constant buzzing sound whenever the display is on. Tried to troubleshoot, and contacted Vizio. They said they can send a replacement, but with an older model (E400i-B2). Instead, exchanged it for a new one at Best Buy. The buzzing sound is a lot less now, and will observe and update review if it persists. Would have been a great value.Update 06/11/2015: The humming sound is still there. No help from Vizio. Best Buy tech says they have seen same problem with a number of sets, and advised me to return it and get a different make/model. Really annoyed.Returned it and got a Samsung UN40J6200, which was $50 more. The new Samsung does not have any problem till now. Hopefully I'll be able to watch some TV at last! I'll be very cautious about Vizio from now on for sure.
