Meh...
Well, after years of hiatus from any kind of Windoze machines, I decided to give them another chance. I did read a few reviews and sounded like this ASUS is a good choice but alasa, I have to admit - I am left very unsatisfied.  Yes, its a very lightweight laptop and the buck stops there.  Here are my main issues with it1. No backlit keyboard - really Asus ?2. Keys could be slightly bigger while you can reduce bezel size on the side and front. Bigger keyboards are more comfortable (atleast for my big hands)3. Trackpad is a big pain and I finally figured out how to disable it. Being a techie, it still took me a long time to figure out how to disable that PoS.4. It comes with a bunch of ASUS crapware installed with no sense of aesthetics (ok - I guess, I've become too used to Mac software).5. Stickers all around the laptop - I dont need to know there is Intel inside or if there is hdmi etc.  The stickers are downright ugly and taking them off is painful and leaves a goo-ee-y substance on the keyboard.6. Why am I  not able to use the laptop monitor as HDMI out from any other device outputting HDMI ?7. Speakers are *meh*.8. After years on a glossy mac (imac and macbook) screen, I personally find the matte screen of this device too dull.9. The dark gray color - I realize, is not for me. I prefer the light siliver finishes on a laptop. Everything just feels too dull.10. Finally, Windows 10 - has a long way to go. Maybe we should wait for Windows 20 to have a usable Operating System :).
