I should have read the information closer....
I mistakenly thought windows 8 was installed on the laptop.  There is no place to put a cd/dvd for installation so everything downloaded has to be on line which does not allow me to download the programs purchased before. I purchased a keyboard and mouse to use with it and am glad as when typing on the laptop keyboard I have to stop and wait for the "typing" to catch up.I did call the help desk to inquire about disks for windows 8 and was told I had to purchase them myself and there is a 30 day return policy. This was one person and I am sure she didn't mean this quite the way it came out.This laptop will be used for some games and once I purchase windows 7 or 8 the kids can use it for school work and it should be fine. I would have rated it higher had windows been installed or if the information had stated there was no windows and if the help desk person had been a little more personable.
