Good Product, Faulty Fan, Pain Ensues...
The product itself is nice, what was delivered though was a laptop with a fan malfunction that spins at 0 RPM. So no big deal, call up Dell right? Well I called up Dell and they asked where I bought it from and apparently the seller on Amazon isn't the correct information of the real seller (Laptop Deals and More). So Dell can't send out a replacement unless I have the correct name listed. So I call Amazon to get the information... all they can give me is the Laptop Deals and More seller name and an email address. Dell would not accept this nor tell me anymore information about the laptop... So I have a broken computer that needs to go back sans the opportunity to use dell technical support. What a pain...
