I bought this netbook for my kid to use with school. It was recommended to over 200 students for completing their homework assignments in class ad online.  after less than 5 months of use one day the cover is closed and opened an hour later only to find lcd display broken.After a call to the customer support for warranty information and instructions to mail for repairs, I find it was going to cost me more to repair something that should have been covered under warranty and is not, now, that it would be for me to buy a brand new notebook.This lcd issue appears to be prevalent, as there are many other kids that have had the same issue.Not Happy.
