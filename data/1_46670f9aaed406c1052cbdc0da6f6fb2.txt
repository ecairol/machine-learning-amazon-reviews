Perfect for My Needs
It's a laptop.  I don't need a large hard drive, but I do want thin, lightweight, and fast.  Boy is it fast.  Startup is the quickest I've ever had on a laptop . . . and it's quiet.  That's the beauty of SSDs.The screen is beautiful -- a matte display that I can view at any angle without washout.  It's not a touchscreen like my other ASUS, but the touchpad is smart.  I can move about the screen, pinch, and scroll just by swiping my fingers.  If I need to type, the keys are comfortably spaced, although I don't find myself typing much on my laptops.What about Windows 10?  It seems to be a combination of Windows 7 and 8.  Windows 7 is great for PCs.  Windows 8 is perfect for touchscreen laptops.  Windows 10 appears to satisfy both.  If you're worried, Zenbook boots into a screen that looks a lot like Windows 7, but we can pull up the tiles, if we want.  I like it.Like many people I know, I mostly use my new laptop to surf the web, check email, and play Candy Crush online.  Okay, I'm not sure how many play Candy Crush.  The Wi-Fi connection is flawless, and I haven't had any issues with battery life (it runs at least 10 hours).Of course, the laptop came with trials of this and that,  but they don't clutter up my desktop.  On the contrary, they are nicely packaged in one area, and I don't feel the need to clean them up because they don't feel like bloatware.  I even took McAfee up on its 30 day trial offer.  So far, so good.
