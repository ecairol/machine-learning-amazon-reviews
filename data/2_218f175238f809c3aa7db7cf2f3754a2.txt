My wife champions the Macbook Air for her work and what a great machine that is
A very solid competitor to the Macbook Air. My wife champions the Macbook Air for her work and what a great machine that is. This laptop has a lot of potential and competes against the Macbook Air in many ways including the battery life. It comes up short, however in a couple of key areas. It is not quite a snappy as the Macbook Air. Understandable given it's a specific mobile processor that the Macbook is not limited by. It also does not have some key refinements like a backlit keyboard and the the quality webcam of the Macbook.I received a defective unit which was returned by Amazon without question (thank you Amazon). I have had other dealings with this laptop aside from this Amazon experience and I will say that this flawed unit is likely an exception as the other units have been flawless. I highly recommend this laptop to impress yourself and everyone around you.
