the bloatware installed by Lenovo will trump anything you put on to replace it and going in to try and uninstall a Lenovo produc
the constant dropping of the WiFi is enough to bite your hand off.  The on/off button on the outer edge is so sensitive that simply blowing on it turns off the computer.  The track pad is beyond infuriating, for no comprehensible reason (by swiping on distinctly different areas of it) it will throw you to the main screen.  the bloatware installed by Lenovo will trump anything you put on to replace it and going in to try and uninstall a Lenovo product is not a fun adventure. I have a feeling a lot of this is on Microsoft but i'm not a nerd enough to say concretely. as I write this, my 9 year old tiny tiny crappy netbook is on and it is full minutes ahead of me (I started them together) listening to the Rolling Stones on YouTube because this computer is constantly dropping the WiFi (and yes I have turned off all the WiFi hunting crap and the Bluetooth bullcrap)...I knew to try a Mac but I was stupid.  not gonna make same mistake twice.
