Love this laptop
Love this laptop. I use it in college and it is so light, I don't have trouble carrying it around anywhere. I bought a wireless mouse to use instead of the pad on the laptop itself because it's a loud click when you use it but it doesn't bother me. I also bought a cd drive as the computer does not come with one. Love the style and capability that this laptop has. Great price.
