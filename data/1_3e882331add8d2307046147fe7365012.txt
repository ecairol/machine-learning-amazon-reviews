Better options out there.
Disappointed.Biggest problem, it has only 2 USB ports. Yes, I know it stated that in the specs - my bad for not thinking it through. Even my 10 year old HP laptop had 3 USB ports, and it had a built in DVD drive. With this laptop you need one USB for a mouse (the track pad is terrible - virtually impossible to click the left or right button without moving the cursor), and one for either a DVD or External HD or a printer. Constantly have to connect and disconnect peripherals. No excuse for this in today's market and with such a stripped down laptop.Display, while adequate for word processing, leaves a lot to be desired for any other use. It was cheap and it shows.
