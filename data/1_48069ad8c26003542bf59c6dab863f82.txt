Apple 64GB iPad Air works as expected.
Works great just make sure you get a good case. The wife beats the heck out of electronics and we purchased this case "iPad Air Case, SUPCASE Heavy Duty Beetle Defense Series Full-body Rugged Hybrid Protective Case Cover with Built-in Screen Protector for Apple iPad Air (Black/Black)" and have had absolutely no issues.
