This MacBook Air clone runs Windows, and is a bargain
This computer is essentially a clone of MacBook Air, but runs Windows. The industrial design of this computer is impeccable. The only other Windows computer that equals or beats this computer in looks and build quality is Samsung ATIV Book 9, but a similarly equipped ATIV costs almost double.On the negative side this computer does not have a backlit keyboard (can't be expected at this price point) and the speakers are kind of feeble.Update 1: I took a star away because this computer has occasional display glitches. Once every 15 minutes or so you get a horizontal row of pixels that have not been rendered correctly. This vanishes quickly when you move the mouse. This issue bothered me enough to exchange the machine, but the replacement has the exact same issue. This seems like an Intel graphics card issue, and a driver update might fix the problem. Despite the issue I decided to keep the machine because there is nothing like this available in this price range.I have attached a photo of the display glitch (see horizontal line on the Recycle Bin).UPDATE 2: A video driver update is now available and it appears to have solved the display problems.UPDATE 3: I have now been able to compare this computer to a Samsung NP940X3G which costs about twice as much. The Samsung has a significantly better screen, a backlit keyboard, and louder speakers. But I like this computer more because it is lighter, quieter (this computer doesn't have or need a fan), the screen is matte, and surprisingly performs better than the Samsung despite having a mobile processor. The Samsung has a touch screen which means it is glossy and has reflections. The display of this computer is slightly below par (colors, contrast etc.) so if you do graphics work this may not be the best computer, and that's the reason I took a star off.
