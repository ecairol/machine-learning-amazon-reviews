I like it for the price
After seeing almost 1000 reviews posted under this, I bought it for use in my school work, necessary just for a semester only. I like it for the price. I had to buy an external drive though later on - I had thought I would not need it but I do for the work I doing with it. I recommend it for anyone looking for a fairly priced laptop.
