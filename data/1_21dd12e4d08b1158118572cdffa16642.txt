It's a BUY, no double. Price over Utility ratio is super.
Pros:1. Super slim2. Same light as a MacBook3. Unbeatable Price on what it givesCons:1. The Sound of mouse pad click is kind of cheap but totally acceptable2. The rebate instruction is not very clearBest Ultra Book at this price level. Used it for a month. Everything runs greatly. MacBook, which cost around USD400 does not even got a USB plug-in, which is to portable to a point that is useless and no point, so I go for this ASUS UX305. Unbeatable for its price/utility ratio. A practical choice. Happy with it.
