and I've loved it for the most part
I've had this Chromebook for about 5 months now, and I've loved it for the most part.  However, just last week, I received a strange warning and my Chromebook crashed.  Since that incident, my trackpad doesn't respond to clicks unless I press very hard, which means drag-and-dropping is much less feasible.  Tapping to place the cursor still works just fine, but I am upset that I've lost some functionality with the loss of clicking.  Has anyone else experienced this?
