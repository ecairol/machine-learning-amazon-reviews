I sent it back and I won't ever buy this ASUS model ever again.
Sent this Chrome back because the unit didn't update and obviously arrived with a glitch. And so glad I did because I bought myself instead a white Chrome laptop with a 15.6" screen and fantastic speakers! Sadly this is my first ASUS return of any kind. Usually my ASUS products I buy are very good and reliable. This was my first ASUS lemon, but it's ok because I sent it back.
