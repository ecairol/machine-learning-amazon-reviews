Bit disapponted
My order came a day earlier than promised.  Kudos to Amazon!! However, I am a bit disappointed with the Lenova yoga 2 on several issues.  First, after two days of use, I am being asked to upgrade the Intel HD Graphics and also the display audio drivers, when the date of manufacture was only last 14/06/27.  Why can't Lenovo and Intel install more stable drivers?  Can Lenovo and/or Intel not provide free upgrade on its drivers, at least within one year of purchase or from manufacture?  Another issue is it sometimes takes a long time before the device could shut down using the power option.  I then had to shut it down thru the power button.  But then, it takes time to boot up.  This is my third laptop and I must say that this is the first time I had this sad experience from a device.  Lenovo should do something about this.
