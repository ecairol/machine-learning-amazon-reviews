I WILL NEVER TOUCH ANOTHER LENOVO PRODUCT EVER AGAIN!
I don't say that lightly. Really wanted this computer to work for my daughter. She might have given up on trying to do schoolwork on a computer at this point. Here are just some of the reasons why:So much bloatware comes installed with this laptop, it is literally unusable right out of the box. A fresh install has over 85 processes running in Windows 7 with no applications launched? Or 75% RAM memory chewed up in the same state (looking at desktop with nothing running).But you get a copy of Windows 8, right? They even give you the discs...with no disc drive from which to launch them... Are you kidding me? I am convinced the low price is also achieved by Lenovo employing absolutely no people whatsoever. I just can't imagine a marketing team of 4th graders could come up with that. Our fault though, my wife happened to miss the line on the spec list that said no cd/dvd drive. I can't remember the last time I saw a laptop (not tablet) that didn't include a cd drive. Wait, I know why! Because I have never seen it. Ever.Screen is lowest grade. Whatever resolution specs are claimed, I suspect are outright lies. The graphics on most androids UNDER 4.0 run smoother.No useful software is available except to provide a link for you to go buy.Taking a wad of 13 $20 bills and lighting it on fire would have been more useful.
