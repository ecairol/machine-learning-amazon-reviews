Stay away!
If you're looking for a Chromebook, go with an Acer or an HP. This one is a piece of crap. Shipped with a bad touchpad. I dealt with it as long as I could then sent it in for repair (my only option). It came back over 2 weeks later with a bad touchpad - different issue, same component. I'd give it 0 stars if I could.
