Does not work as advertised
Great picture and remote is cool; but I bought this thinking it could play simple online video.  Namely TV shows that require me to connect a laptop to the TV.. thereby taking the laptop away from the user.  However major networks are blocking Google TV; and using my cable provider's site shows that a flash player update is necessary.  The update will not install and there are not updates for/ from the Hisense device.
