Love the laptop to death but mine hd one TINY little problem...
It runs beautifully... But it stopped charging 20 days after I bought it. I contacted ASUS and they we're very helpful. They agreed to fix it and are even paying the shipping. Great customer service. They didn't ask any dumb questions and there was virtually no wait time. They didn't give me a number in India like HP did to me with my HP 2000 either and a real HUMAN ASKED ME QUESTIONS -_-  I will write more when the laptop comes back for repairs. They said it should take 2 weeks. Let's find out.UPDATE:It stopped charging 20 days after I got it. Now, on 2/27/2015 I'm sitting in class, just listening to music on the windows media player, not doing anything else, and it cuts off. Its not reacting to being plugged into the wall (no lights are coming on at all) so I'm beyond pissed. I'll update when, if ever, I get my laptop back. Until then, it gets 2 stars.
