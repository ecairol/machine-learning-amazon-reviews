Complete waste of money.
So I have had the Chromebook since Christmas.  Bought one for my son and one for myself.  Boy was that a mistake.It is useless as a laptop.  Just get a tablet because this thing has none of the features you would look for in a laptop other than that there is a keyboard there....but it is close to useless.When you navigate onto a page it often will not move up or down within the page....you have to try to use the sidebar up and down thingy but that doesn't move smoothly.  There is no right click feature that works and it jumps in page so you really can not read stories or browse through pages.My son stopped using his ages ago....he prefers his tablet.  He can not get any of his school work done....I was told there were Apps for everything but they are useless for my son's schoolwork.It was a complete waste of money....I mean really....you can't do anything useful with it.
