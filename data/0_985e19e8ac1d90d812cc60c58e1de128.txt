I had this chrome book for less than 3 months the screen started flickering contacted the company , they said that it can be  repaired and after many calls computer was returned to their repair center end of december 014 and I am still waiting for the status for repair. I maid numerous calls to the company and with no answer, This week I made another call they kept me on the phone for almost an hour they did not provide me with any answer and I am without a computer for almost a months. I tried to get on their web site to find status of my repair the page was not available because of maintenance issue? I will not buy their products again
