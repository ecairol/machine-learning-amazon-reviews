and great for just surfing the internet
I have had this for about two months.  Overall is a decent secondary computer, very light weight, long battery life, and great for just surfing the internet, but it does slow down considerably when you have more than 5 or 6 tabs open.  The keyboard feels a tad cheap and can be touchy at times, but it is much better than a virtual keyboard.Then again this is not meant to be a primary laptop or compete with a Mac Air.  This is still a early version of where computing is headed with a web based OS.  Google is doing a great job so far and continually improving the experience with Chrome OS.Overall it is a nice computer to use as your secondary computer and for when you are traveling as well.
