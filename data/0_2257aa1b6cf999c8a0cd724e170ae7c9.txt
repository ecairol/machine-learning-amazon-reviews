No Speakers, No Microphone....
Within two months of purchasing, the Conexant speaker/microphone system failed. The computer itself runs fine but I no longer have the ability to Skype, listen to movies and so on without headphones, and any related procedure. I would never buy this again versus paying more and getting something more reliable like a Surface Pro.
