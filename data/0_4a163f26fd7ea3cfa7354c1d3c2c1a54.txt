DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU PLAN ON INSTALLING WINDOWS 7 OR IF YOU DO NOT LIKE BLOATWARE
I purchased this computer and it came with windows 8. Let me tell you about the cons on that.1. The superfish malware that has hit global news (which allows you to be hacked extremely easily) was pre installed2. It comes with a ton of bloatware3. No problem right? I'll just put windows 7 on it and it will be clean and ready to go. WRONG!!!! Lenova claims you can switch the boot mode from UEFI to Legacy mode, but that is simply incorrect. You cannot change it. It gives you absolutley no option to. The boot mode is greyed out.4. There tech support is absolute garbage
