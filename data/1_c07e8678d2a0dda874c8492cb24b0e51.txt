Gets the job done, get what you pay for but nothing more. Mediocre screen.
Summary: This laptop will work for when you need something thin and light that you don't have to worry about breaking/losing because it was cheap. It will not be a suitable replacement for a primary PC/Laptop however. Great for checking email, browsing the news and reddit.Positives:This device is slim and attractive looking, the battery is very long as well. The included webcam is good enough, the keyboard is reasonably spacious. Track-pad feels nice to the touch and is responsive. Cheap. Very good for most people who just want to check email. I have the 4gb option and it is able to handle many more applications at once than I would have expected. I can have a dozen tabs in chrome, Ubuntu, sublime text, and Firefox open all at the same time without any noticeable speed penalty.Bad:- The way you click the mouse is entirely non-functional. It took me several days to even realize that the mouse click was beneath the trackpad, I just assumed there was no button. The button is so useless its pointless to even try clicking it, just stick to tapping on the trackpad.- The screen is very dim, very poor color representation. It will suit well enough for dealing with text documents, but you will not be watching movies on this screen, it is just too low of quality and very dim.Other: you CANNOT INSTALL ANYTHING OTHER THAN CHROME APPS without booting into a Linux desktop. I'm currently running crouton with Ubuntu/Unity and it actually runs pretty well, its just inconvenient since I only really need it for Python which frustratingly cannot be installed in the crippled developer shell but this is a shortcoming of ChromeOS, not the ASUS C300.
