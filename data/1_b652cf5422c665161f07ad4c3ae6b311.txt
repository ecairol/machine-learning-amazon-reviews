3 star problem with speed and PDF
It is a good computer for the price. It didn't come with a mouse and often time is slow. The price was great and storage amount is very good. No problem with Microsoft. I also have problem viewing PDF files. I don't know why? It opens as blank or the PDF that I was looking while back but recently it is only a black screen. I am doing my doctorate and this PDF situation is really frustrating.
