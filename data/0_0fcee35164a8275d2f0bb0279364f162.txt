unhappy I got it!
I got a 16gb Ipad. By the time I got everything set up I do not even have room for a single app. I do not know what is going on with it but it is ridiculous. I have wanted one for a long time and I wish I never got it. What a waste of money. Cant even get one game because there is no room. What the heck is apple doing!!!!
