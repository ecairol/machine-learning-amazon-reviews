Asus....Not what it is advertised to be.
Not what it is advertised. Not 500Gb.  Two drives of less than that. Have not yet decided what we are going to do about it. Performance levels are questionable  Without a DVD drive  (or even a CD rom drive), we should probably receive another one for what we paid for this.
