This is the worst lap top I have ever owned
This is the worst lap top I have ever owned.I have had it in a lap top repair shop 3 times which has cost me over 100.00.Because I purchased it on AMAZON I have no idea where to take it for repairs. Im having problems with it again.I live on Social Security so these expenses are really hard for me to spend this kind of money. I didn't even have it for 3 months before I had to spend 60.00 on it.Im so disappointed I cant even explain and have had to hold myself back from throwing it out the window.It is my main source of entertainment as Im a disabled senior citizen and cant getn out very often.I think they should replace it but I don't know how to do that.I have already put more then half of what I spent on it and its still not working right.Sorry for the language but its a piece of CRAP !!!!!
