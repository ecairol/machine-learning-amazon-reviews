Ethernet port is unstabler/unreliable.
I bought one of these units, and after checking a few connections, it seemed to be working fine.  The next day, it could not connect to the internet.  I tried moving the TV to various other jacks in the house, to no avail.  It did connect when I hooked it directly up to the FiOS router however.  I then hooked it up to the switch, and it wouldn't connect again.  I then took it back to the FiOS router, and now it wouldn't connect there either.  Since it would connect via wireless, I deemed the wired Ethernet port to be at fault and returned it.With the 2nd unit, same issues.  I then connected a Roku unit to the TV, using the same Ethernet port/cable, and the Roku has no issues connecting to the internet and streaming a good strong signal.What is the point of having a "smart TV" if you can't rely on its connection?Done with this brand!  :(
