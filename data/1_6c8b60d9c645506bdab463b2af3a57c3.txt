Going to be hard to beat for the price.
For the most part I really like this laptops - don't like Windows 8 at all, but that isn't the hardwares fault.  It is a little bigger than I'd like but for the price I find it hard to complain much.  Speed is decent for what I need it for which is mostly working on MS Office, email, and working online.  The reason for the one star deduction is that the case does feel a little weak so time will tell how it holds up.  So much happier with this than a netbook!
