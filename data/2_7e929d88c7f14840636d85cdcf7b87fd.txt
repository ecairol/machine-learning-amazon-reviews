UX305 Truly Remarkable for Only $699
The $699 price is truly remarkable considering it's predecessor, the UX303, cost $840. Out of the box the UX305 shines as an everyday thin and light notebook. My biggest con is the A/C adapter. The adapter "block" is too big and heavy. It tends to fall out of the wall socket. .
