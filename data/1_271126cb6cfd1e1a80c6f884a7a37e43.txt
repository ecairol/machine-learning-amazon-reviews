Good TV, defective, but good.  Worth the Money
Bought mine from another source, but it this TV has an amazing picture, better then my 55" vizio smart TV.  My screen has lines in it after just a few weeks, so I am guess that I merely received a defective unit, and i have yet to replace it.  Any issues that the previous reviewer said about the interface has been fixed, although i did notice one misspelling.  An excellent pick for a buyer on a budget...  I would purchase any warranty that amazon or third party is offering however, as the company is in china and any issues would have to be resolved with them.  Furthermore, any shipping to china would negate the cost advantage of this unit over more expensive models...
