videos wont play and your articles/video will be permanently blocked
Videos will not play on this Chromebook. This means if you are looking for an article, etc to read and you cannot read the article until the advert is viewed first you will never be able to read your article because the advert video will not play. I wanted to listen to cbs sports radio on their radio.com link but I cannot as I can't view their advert video first. Anyone have a solution? Thanks
