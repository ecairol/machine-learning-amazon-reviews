BEWARE of unusable iPad Air!
The iPads I purchased from TechGiant were not as they were described! When I took them to T-mobile to activate these "brand new ipads", I was told that they could not activate 4G on any of the 8 ipads I purchased! This was because all 8 were previously owned and blocked for FRAUD! TechGiant is selling previously owned items!  TechGIANT I would appreciate it if you contacted me directly to resolve this asap!
