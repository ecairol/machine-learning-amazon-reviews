Does not run Skype.
Just one thing. This does not run SKYPE. There are some work arounds but they are really a pain. MS and Google are in a pissing match (MS owns Skype) and the consumer suffers. So, if you depend upon Skype, don't buy a Chromebook. Otherwise, this is a great little computer which does everything else as one would expect from a Google device.
