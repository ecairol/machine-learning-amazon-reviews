It's very nice, but...
When getting my product in the mail I was super excited. On arrival everything looked perfect and intact. After putting my information in and setting it up I noticed the R button on the keyboard was messed up and could easily fall off. I constantly have to pop it back into place when I use it and it has become very annoying. Other then that I have no complaints. I ended up having to download OpenOffice due to having no Microsoft word But It works just the same id say.
