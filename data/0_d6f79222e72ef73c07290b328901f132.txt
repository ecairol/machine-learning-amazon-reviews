Chromebook design works but ASUS may have low build quality
Bought this 13IN chromebook for school work. The chromebook system works very well for me since wifi is available in most of the area in my school. Although lack software support, its less than 10 seconds boot up time still makes it my go-to machine for online lectures, web browsing, and pretty much any other tasks that requires internet connection (i.e. writing this review/complaint letter). The only thing I don't like about this product is it does not have a back-lit keyboard. My main complaint about my purchase is also keyboard related. It starting to act up after six months of use. The key strokes at "g", "h", and "backspace" became non-responsive, and I had to use an external keyboard to get around this issue. Chromebook is aimed toward the lower budget laptop market. I feel Asus had sacrificed their quality on the low cost laptop from this experience, and it surely is a shame. I am going to RMA this laptop. If the repair costs more than $50, I will probably scrap it and try another manufacture for the $200.00 chromebook, maybe Acer or HP.
