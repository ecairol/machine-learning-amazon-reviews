This laptop is a big disappointment, though it is really beautiful
This laptop is a big disappointment, though it is really beautiful, light, and the battery is pretty good.I got it five days ago, and the display driving stopped responding for 4 times. I was shocked when the screen suddenly turned black, after all it is a new laptop. Please, what I did is only watching videos on Youtube. Maybe it is a punishment for not studying for finals but watching videos.And sometimes switching language input can be provoking. I have to press the button for 4 or 5 times to change the language.When I type, some buttons don't response, I need to press the button again to type the letter in.The sound of cooling fan is even larger than my old laptop.Is this only happen to me?The only star is for its appearance.I will never buy asus laptop again.
