AWESOME TV for the MONEY
I bought this TV 2 weeks ago and I am very happy and impressed with the picture. It is a "GREAT BUY" . The clear motion is great especially when I was watching The Chicago  Blackhawks Stanley Cup Finals. There wasn't any blur of any kind. I really like the thin border around the screen and the stock TV Stand is perfect for me to fit my Sound Bar under the TV.  The only weak thing about this TV is it's sound but that's pretty much the same problem all TV's have because of the thinness of them. A good Sound Bar alleviates this problem.  Overall I would recommend this TV to anyone.
