So Quiet!
There are a lot of good reviews for this item, so I will make this short but sweet for anyone having doubts on this laptop vs. a few other options. (Since I couldn't make up my mind and ordered 3 over the last week.)Asus Zenbook UX305FA-ASM1 vs. Dell XPS 13 13ULT-7144sLV vs. Surface Pro 3 (128 GB, Intel Core i5)Yes, the Zenbook has less power than the other 2 above, however, because of this lack of power (Intel M), there was an unforeseen advantage for me. I.E., Fanless! This is a HUGE deal when you are putting your laptop through its paces... because both the Dell and Surface 3 get LOUD. Loud and hot. And the Zenbook gets neither! Yes, there is a little bit of heat near the F9 key when the Intel M processor is pushing the limit (~2Ghz), but it is not nearly the same temperature as the Surface's top right hand corner, for instance.This is what I had open and used to measure processing power, temperature, and audible fan speed:- Pono (J-river media player), playing FLAC files.- Fostex HP-A4 DAC outputting the files above.- Chrome, 10+ tabs, including Google Play uploading function which takes a considerable amount of resources itself.- Norton Anti-Virus in the background.- Other background processes, i.e., Wi-Fi full blast, file transfers from external drive via usb 3.0, asus, onedrive, and google drive web storages consistently updating.The Zenbook never got above 90 degree CPU temp, 50% Ram (~4GB), and CPU was at 100% only during the Google Play uploading. Otherwise was mostly hovering around 10-30% depending on tasks. Let's just say the Dell and SP3 both sounded like vacuum cleaners running at full blast with a portable heater blowing in my face. :)Tldr; buy the Zenbook, you (and your ears) will not be disappointed.
