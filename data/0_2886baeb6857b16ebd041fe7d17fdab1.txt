Very unhappy customer
Like other reviewers, I have also had the problem of this computer freezing up about 8 times and hour after owning it a few short months.  I will be lucky to finish this review without it freezing up.  It is not my internet connection btw, there are other laptops in this house that do not have this problem. It is too late to return it, otherwise I would.
