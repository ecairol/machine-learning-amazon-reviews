Worked fine for about 4 months
Worked fine for about 4 months. Than it started locking up. At first a restart would work, but after a week or so it displayed that the operating system was missing and needed to be reloaded. This is done by downloading an app to a thumb drive but it wouldn't load to the chromebook. I figured the Solid State Drive was bad, so I opened it up, of course voiding the warranty, only to find it was soldered to the main board and couldn't replaced. At that point I had about 40 tiny screws in a pile, so I threw the whole thing in the garbage. I may have just gotten a lemon, but keep in mind that this model can't be repaired or upgraded more memory.
