What was in your unboxing?
Hello everyone, I just received mine today and I must say I'm enjoying it.But I just had a question to others about the packaging..Mine came WITHOUT the cable ties like the unboxing videos I've watched and had everything in a seal under the laptop that had screen wipe, warranty card and a little manual all supported by a carboard.and cables + Ethernet usbJust curious as to how others got it. Got mine (June 26, 2015)USING the device:I've only been playing with the device for a little bit now and the only issue is the driver failure crash once in a while and the trackpad is unbearable coming from a Macbook Pro. I love how Windows 8 come preinstalled and as soon as you get you computer set up it asks you to reserve a Windows 10.I've only been doing basics like browsing the web with Google Chrome, watching Youtube, Facebook Messenger.Also a bit of html, css, javascript with SublimeText and testing it out on Chrome.I've only been using this laptop for a couple hours now and I'd say the driver failure happened about 3 or 4 times. Nothing serious though. The screen goes black for about 2~4 seconds and come right back. Hope this is just a Windows 8 issue that will be resolved in the upcoming Windows 10.Thanks~
