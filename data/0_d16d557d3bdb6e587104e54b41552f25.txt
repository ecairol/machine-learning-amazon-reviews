Intel dual band adapter / Windows 8 issues rendered wifi useless, a shame becase all else was great
Revised review after additional troubleshooting:There are documented issues with both the Intel adapter and Windows 8.  Most of the time, it seems like the machine works beautifully, but in some cases, the wifi is very unstable.  The easiest and most reliable fix is what a commenter mentioned - simply disable the internal adapter and get an external one.If I needed a Windows machine, that is what I would have done, but over a decade of dealing with various versions of Windows has finally taken its toll and I returned the machine.  I no longer have the time nor inclination to care for such a fussy OS.  I'm not computer illiterate, just spoiled by other devices that are effortless in comparison.  I've lost my patience with Microsoft.If you can deal with the typical issues that always crop up with Windows, this is a great machine.  Fast, light, great price.  And it is more likely to work than not to.  Just be sure the return policy is good.
