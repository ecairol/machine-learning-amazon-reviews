I had high expectations with this being a machine from the same people who build the ROG high end gear (ASUS).  Big disappointment.  Wifi would not connect without lots of repeat tries.  Now I do not trust it.  Screen has a very narrow viewing angle of about 60 degrees.  It's therefore a very personal personal computer.  Others have noted that Googles Chromebook VPN is pretty bad to setup and use.  But the clincher was when I tried to use my gmail.  It told me my browser was too out of date to use gmail.In a word "WTF Google."  They seem to require a manual download to fix that.  This is just false advertising in raw form.  This machine goes back.
