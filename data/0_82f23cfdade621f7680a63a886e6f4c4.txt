DO NOT BUY-TV broke in 2 weeks and Vizio support is USELESS.
I would give this 0 stars if possible.  I bought the TV and it worked great for 2 weeks before breaking.  The TV will only power on using the remote (the power button on the back doesn't work) but no other keys will work.  I can't change the input using the remote or the button on the back nor can I use any of the functions of the TV- it's essentially stuck on the current input.  Bear in mind this is after just 2 weeks of use.  I called Vizio support for a new TV and they agreed to ship a new TV out.  However, 20 days after the initial request, I have yet to receive the TV.  Vizio says they outsource the delivery and are no longer taking responsibility for the delivery.  I tracked the package using their number and it has been in my city for the past 10 days, but I've gotten no call for a delivery.  I've been calling Vizio all week and they keep saying "call back in 24-48 hours for an update" every time I call.Bottom Line- TV crapped out in 2 weeks and Vizio hasn't delivered a replacement.
