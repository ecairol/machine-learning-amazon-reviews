waste of money
If you want to keep your sanity do not buy this computer. I bought it 2 month ago and there is no single week that goes by without it having issues. It crashes all the time, crashes even when you try to power it down. It can not deal with updates without crashing. It goes in tablet mode randomly and leaves the keyboard useless. The newest issue I found is that it will not recognize my Samsung phone as a data device. So I cannot pull any pictures off my phone.This computer was supposed to be my work computer which can be easily carried back and forth, but as it has several times refused to even open any kind of files when I needed them, its a piece of worthless junk. I deeply regret spending any money on it.
