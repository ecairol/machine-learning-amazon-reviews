the item itself is great but I don't know what I expected
not exactly what I had in mind..... the item itself is great but I don't know what I expected.... I know I should have checked to see if the screen was the kind you could control with, which it is not and I need a mouse. I hate it. NO FAULT OF THE PRODUCT, IT IS MY FAULT.... I DON'T KNOW ABOUT COMPUTERS AND WHAT TO EXPECT.... THE GRANDKIDS LOVE IT.
