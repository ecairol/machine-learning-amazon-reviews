Not impressed
I'm not super impressed with this laptop.  I will start with the touchpad.  It's terrible.  The multi-gesture functions do not work smoothly at all.  Clicking and dragging to use the chromebook equivalent of snipping tool is an exercise in frustration.  You click, but when you begin the drag portion, you lose your "grip" on the selection and have to start over.  I often find this taking two hands to do.  Scroll and zoom work intermittently at best, and sometimes even single click works not at all.  If you tap the touchpad for a click it will work, but if you actually press down and "click" the touchpad, it works about 50 % of the time.  You need that "hard click" for things like grab, drag and drop though.  The touchpad is just junk in my opinion.  I can't even scroll inside this text window as I write this review.  The same gesture to do that actually scrolls the whole browser window about 70% of the time.The speed of this machine is not all its cracked up to be either.  Yeah, it turns off and on quickly.  No problem with the boot, but with the navigation, even locally to open my files, or something from an external hard drive which was plugged in... it's like trying to watch a youtube video on iphone 4 with 2G.  Extremely slow.  Often the machine will lock up when I scroll through pictures if those pictures are on an external device plugged into the machine.I also find odd quirks happening, for example, I try to go to amazon.com and the browser gets stuck in kind of a 'refresh state'  where it keeps trying to reload the site over and over and over.... cache clearing and all of that does nothing.  A restart is what it takes to get working again.After selling my macbook, I thought I'd try a chromebook, but in retrospect, I feel that the stateless devices should remain phones and tablets.  In my opinion, a laptop with local storage and a full OS is the way to go.  Lesson learned.
