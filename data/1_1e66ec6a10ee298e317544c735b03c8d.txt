Great close up, blurry when filming distance
I purchased this webcam intending to get high-quality images from my apartment window of the NY skyline.  Unfortunately, the camera is unable to focus to infinity.  It is designed only for close-in webcam chatting.  Distant objects (or even the back wall of a large room) appear blurry.
