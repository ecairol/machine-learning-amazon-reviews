If you want to use this as PC, don't reccomend.
I purchased this at Bestbuy in April 10th. I returned this on 19th. So, during 9 days, I installed Firefox, google drive for my work, Quickbooks and office 2013. Office 2013 was installed at bestbuy, but this never work. Not even open the application. It crushed 3 times and turned off all of the sudden. I brought it to the Tech support (Geek) at Bestbuy, and a guy suggested me to return or exchange. I returned since Geek guy and I both didn't know what is causing the problem not be able to open office and crash. So, I returned instead. what a waste of my time for this 9 days....
