Eh...if you buy it, consider asking to purchase a warranty if one is not offered for purchase.
We have had this exactly since Christmas 2014.  It was a good price, but I truly do not recall being offered the 2 year drop/spill warranty that is now offered with it.  Regardless, I thought it may have come with at least a 1 year warranty for defects or something.  Nothing.It is now July 7, 2015 and the display gets fuzzy or filled with lines making it very difficult to decipher what is on the screen.  Well, I title the monitor portion of the laptop at just the right angle, the display either gets clear or fuzzier.  It's very hit or miss and I'm not satisfied with this aspect - ESPECIALLY since this product is no longer eligible for return.  I'm not sure what else to do and it's very frustrating.
