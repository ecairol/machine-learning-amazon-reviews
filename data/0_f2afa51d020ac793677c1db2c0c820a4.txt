This computer is terrible. It crashes all the time
This computer is terrible.  It crashes all the time.  I have the largest hard drive available.  Totally maxed out the computer with memory and power.  Dell hasn't figured it out yet.  I loathe the day I did not get a macbook air.  No one to take it to get it serviced.  No support system.Stay away from Dell.
