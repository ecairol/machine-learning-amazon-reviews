Wireless Capabilities Disappear Every Few Days/No WiFi Adapter Detected
Having to knock this down to one star.  Drivers for WiFi adapter kept dropping out, so for a bout a week I kept having to reinstall them.  Now the WiFi adapter isn't even being detected by the computer.  A waste of time and money, and there is no helpful information out there beyond software issues.  Seems I got a bad egg of a computer/WiFi adapter and I can't even send it back... I am super pissed.
