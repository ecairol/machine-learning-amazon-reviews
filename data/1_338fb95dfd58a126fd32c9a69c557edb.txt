Great Computer, especially for the Price.
I received the computer about a week ago and am very pleased.  It did not have a DVD drive, but I bought one for $20, so no big deal.  I am quite surprised to find a laptop with this screen size, an AMD dual core processor with so much RAM and Hard Drive Space.  I also love that it came with Windows 7 which works so much better than the windows 8.  It did come with the windows 8 disc though if I want to downgrade my computer.  An excellent buy!
