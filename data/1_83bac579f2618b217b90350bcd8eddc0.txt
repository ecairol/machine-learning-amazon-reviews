Nice HD monitor, but not much of a "smart" TV
Dear Yahoo - If this is part of how you plan to revitalize your flailing company, you need to seriously think again.  History has shown that limiting people's options so that they HAVE to use your services will in fact backfire.Dear fellow shoppers - Here's my rundown on this TV.  Great picture, but the availability to apps and the generally slow interface are frustrating.  It's nice that this high-quality TV was so inexpensive, but once you factor in the fact that you'll still need a Roku or other app-connecting device, it's not as much savings as you might think.  Combine that with the frustrations I've mentioned, and it's even more expensive.  Yes, this is a "smart TV" but because I didn't do my research very well ahead of time, I didn't realize that the Vizio/Yahoo partnership limits what you can access quite a bit.  You can only get the apps that Vizio has approved, which is a huge limiting factor.  The only apps you can access through this TV (that are actually worth a thing) are Netflix, Amazon, and a few others.  I couldn't access Sling, and even though Pandora is on there and I've added my account information, it won't pull up.If you just think of this TV as basically a nice HD monitor that you can connect to your Roku, you're fine.  If you're looking for more, then keep looking.
