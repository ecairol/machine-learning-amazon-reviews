Spotty wifi connectivity after just a few months of use
I bought this Chromebook for my 9th grade daughter to use at school. It connected fine to the school wifi for the first two months, then became spotty. Now, it connects in 1-2 classes and that's it. Spotty connectivity elsewhere, as well. I saw another reviewer had the same issue and sent her device back twice and received it only to have the same problem occur. I'm not sure I'm up for dealing with that hassle and may consider a school-issued loan iPad instead. Would not purchase this product or recommend in the future.
