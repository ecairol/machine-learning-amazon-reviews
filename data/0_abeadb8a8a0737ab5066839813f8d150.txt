Sometimes its actually kind of awful
This laptop is decent. However the speakers suck and I have had to buy 6 new chargers because the charger design is terrible and it constantly keeps on breaking. One time I kept on trying to get the charger to work so hard that the charger hole got bent and i had to put my computer in the shop. Honestly I actually have had quite a few problems with this computer but it is not completely awful all of the time.
