Has hardware issues
Very disappointed. The WiFi card had issues. The signal was so weak I had to stand next to the router to use it and even then I barely have one bar. I called dell support and have been on the phone for over an hour. The technical support agents tried updating drivers and the bios but no help. I am extremely disappointed in this product and do not recommend it. Others seems to have no problems so maybe it is hit or miss, but when you miss it is terrible and not worth the risk.
