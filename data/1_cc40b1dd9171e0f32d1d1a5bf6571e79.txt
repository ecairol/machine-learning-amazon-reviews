I have always had a great experience with their customer support
I purchased this laptop for $200. On the day it arrived it was down to $179. I called Amazon and they refunded the difference. Way to go Amazon! I have always had a great experience with their customer support.As to the laptop. The good- fast boot time, works seamlessly with the Google environment (Google drive, Google plus, search, etc). The case is looks and feels good. Value for the price (@$179). Great battery life, lightweight. The bad - the screen resolution. This is not a device I will watch a lot of movies on. Don't think of comparing it to a Kindle, Ipad, or other PC. The video looks washed out and stutters. The ugly - As others have mentioned video stutters, and there are small delays (skips) when viewing web pages. You push the down arrow and then the page moves a second later. I think this problem is more related to the amount of memory (2GB) instead of the processor. Also, for the first two weeks the device kept losing the wireless signal and I would get a message that I have lost internet connection. None of my other devices have this problem. But, the more I used the laptop the more the problem started to disappear. I have not had the problem in the last week. I suspect that this may be due to Google updating the OS behind the scene. Conclusion - If you want a device that gets on the internet quickly, integrates with the Google environment, is well made and a good value (@179) then this is the device for you. If you want something that is fast, and to watch movies with pass on this device.
