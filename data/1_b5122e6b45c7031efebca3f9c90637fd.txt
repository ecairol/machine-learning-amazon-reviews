Ok as a back up or kids computer.
Ok as a back up or kids computer. Bought it because I work on a MAC and sometimes need a PC. It does the job but the keyboard is awkward since the keys are shifted off set to the right. The home row is not centered, so for fast typers it is awkward. Keys and keyboard very cheap feeling. Hey, you do get what you pay for.
