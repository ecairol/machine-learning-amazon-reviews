very unhappy
I could not get Office 2013 to work on this computer, Lenovo charged me $70.00 to try on a 4 day old computer. They tried for 2 days and could not get it to work. They blamed Micro Soft and would not take back the unit. I called Amazon they returned it plus gave me back the $70.00 I spent with Lenovo. I purchased a Dell from Amazon and down loaded Office 13 with out a hitch. I love Amazon and my new DEll Inspiron 3000. Lenovo what are you thinking? Customer service and satisfaction should be a Number 1 priority. If I can't use Office on this unit then it's only purpose would be a door stop.
