I was very disappointed in this CB
I was very disappointed in this CB.  My first one was a Samsung and it worked great for several years.  I bought this one in 12/14 to replace it based on good reviews.  Within the first few weeks I noticed the screen would blackout unless you had the angle adjusted to a certain angle.  It got worse and worse and now only works pushed all the way back with me keeping pressure on the top of the case with my hand.  Makes it unusable as you can't really type while trying to hold the screen in place.  The volume is VERY low also.  Even all the way up you can't hear it unless you are right in front of it.  Not good for playing Pandora or anything.  I looked into getting it fixed and was told for what it would cost, it was not worth fixing.  My son loved his ASUS laptop so I had high hopes for this but it is pretty useless now and was in less than 6 months.
