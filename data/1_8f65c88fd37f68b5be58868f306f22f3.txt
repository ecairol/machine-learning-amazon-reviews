Laptop dead after 12 days. Hard disk was replaced after servicing within warranty period.
Got the laptop 12 days back, today while using it, it got switched off. Not restarting after that, I have to send it to service center. Not a good experience at all.EDIT:Sent laptop to service center and they replaced the hard disk. So far working okay without any issue. It took around two weeks to get the laptop fixed.
