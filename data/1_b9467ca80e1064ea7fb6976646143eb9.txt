nice thin bezel
The TV is very good-looking, nice thin bezel, easy to assemble, and very light.  Picture quality is definitely sufficient for the price, and I haven't even had time to tweak it manually yet.  My first issue is minor, and it is that it does not support a 5.0GHz wireless band, which is what I like to use for my streaming devices.Second though, was that upon selecting picture presets, the back of the TV(not the speakers) started to hum depending on the setting.  After playing with it, it appears that the Auto Brightness Control setting is causing the hum to get louder or change tone.  Only the Vivid and Computer setting would not hum, and the Auto Brightness Control is set to OFF in those settings, but in all of the others, it is set to low, med, or hi, and the hum becomes louder the higher you get.  Turning ON the Auto Brightness Control on Vivid or Computer mode will cause it to start humming again, and weirdly, turning it OFF on the other presets causes it to hum the loudest, no rhyme or reason really.  I want to get this issue fixed instead of just sticking with Vivid or Computer mode all of the time.I got in touch with Vizio support, and they were very quick and helpful, I have scheduled an on-site swap, at which point I will update this review.5/11/15 Update: Their contracted shipper came and swapped out the TV, they hung around a few minutes so I could plug it in and test it, there was no hum on this one at all, so it seems like the original one was just a dud.
