Not a bad laptop, but not a great one
I bought this for my dad to replace his 3 year old laptop and it was cheap and the specs all looked far better than the old HP one (Better hard drive, RAM, etc.) but my dad says its definitely running slower than his old one, and all he really uses it for are his Facebook games that he is addicted to. I guess because it doesn't have a dedicated graphics or something computery I don't really want to get into.Regardless, it was still pretty cheap and otherwise I'm sure its good.
