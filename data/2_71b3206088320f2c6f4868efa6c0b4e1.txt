Good for college students
Good for college students!Those who complain about these devices really don't do their research beforehand.Youtube lags? Disable html5 player.Cannot play local video files? Get the format right, or install VLC in croutoneverything too small for your old eyes? Change the d*** DPI, or get the one with crappier 1366x768 screen.This chromebook really looks like a Mac (UNIX), and if you install ubuntu (UNIX-like) and macbuntu themes, you can fool some friends.Since I'm gonna use this for note taking, I installed Office 2010, Adobe Acrobat Pro, Evernote. VLC plays 1080p bluray just fine, and it looks stunning on this screen.Battery life is around 9 hours if i dont do anything heavy, browse some web.If you plan to install linux, i suggest getting a mini usb3.0 thumbdrive instead of using SD card. Bay Trail device like this will unmount SD card when ChromeOS goes to sleep. When you wake up, ChromeOS incorrectly remounts it as read-only, so your crouton will crash. usb drive dont get unmounted, so it won't have this problem
