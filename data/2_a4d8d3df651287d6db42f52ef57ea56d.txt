The system's performance is quite good and screen quality is excellent
This is my second chromebook as my first (HP Chromebook 14) was plagued with problems (fan noises, touchpad problems).  I opted for the 2gb memory configuration as I did not think I needed the extra memory and storage as I am not a big music or video downloader and rely on Google Drive for my storage needs.The system's performance is quite good and screen quality is excellent.  I was looking for a "fan less" system and the Asus does not disappoint.  The colors are a little weird and probably would have gone with black if I had to use the device for work - but this is my personal travel machine and hopefully the people sitting next to me on the plane won't think I am strange given the bright blue color.At first I was reluctant to step back to a 13 inch screen having gotten use to the 14 inch screen on the HP Chromebook.  But I have not noticed any difference in viewing ability.  And with the machine being about 1 lb lighter - I am glad I made the switch.  You really notice the difference with the lighter, smaller power supply (very similar to a tablet charger).  Battery life is excellent.Keyboard response is excellent and only complaint I have is that the sharp edges on the sides of the machine do tend to "cut" into your arms and wrist over time.  Not sure if this will eventually turn me off to using the machine - time will tell.  Overall performance is good - not complaints regarding speed and responsiveness.  Liked the fact that it had an Intel processor and heat has not been a problem even without a fan.So far none of the hardware issues that some other reviewers have complained about.  If I do encounter some issues I will probably not even try to reach Asus support as this can be a frustrating experience.  This Asus device is such a refreshing and positive change from my Nexus 7 that Asus also manufactured - but that is a difference story and a different review!
