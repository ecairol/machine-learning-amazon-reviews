Excellent Performance, Pleasure To Use
This is my first ultra-book and I am extremely pleased with its performance and build.Everything else about this laptop is first rate.  Battery life is excellent.  Startup time with the Solid State Drive is excellent.  Before I bogged it down with Antivirus and Anti Malware software startup was around 10 or 12 seconds.  The screen brightness and uniformity by eye are very good.  Keyboard is a personal thing, but I like the feel and layout and do not need backlighting.I have run two very simple home brew benchmarks which time what I care about; number crunching speed (Matrix computations) and the results surprised me is a good way.  I compared against my 4 year old Dell XPS-8300 desktop which has an i7-2600 cpu  and a workstation laptop which is a Dell Precision M6800 with an i7-4810MQ.  The UX-305 was faster than the desktop by between 2 and 4 times while it was about half the speed of the workstation.  Keep in mind these are not general purpose benchmarks like Passmark.  I do not play video games and am NOT recommending this ultrabook for gaming.  In fact the Passmark scores for the i5Y10 is only 2834 compared with the i7-2600 which is 8271 and the i7-4810MQ (commonly used in gamer laptops I notice) is 8781.I was expecting to use this ultrabook only for web browsing and typing documents, but it appears to be fast enough for hacking code and running somewhat compute intensive things.  This machine is a pleasure to use and exceeds my expectations, particularly at the $699 price point.
