Screen spontaneously cracked
Bought this for my kids to do school work. Within 2 months of owning them the screen on one of the Chromebooks spontaneously cracked after closing and re-opening. Also the screens are a little dim and hard to see at times. So far the second Chromebook is doing okay, but now I'm leery about how long it will take for the screen to become damaged on it as well.
