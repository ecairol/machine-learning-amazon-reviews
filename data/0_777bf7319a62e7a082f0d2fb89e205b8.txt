Not the greatest laptop. After the first few months
Not the greatest laptop. After the first few months, we started to notice a lot of latency when using Google docs. The saving feature started slowing down docs to a dead halt, where it was pretty much useless to us. Not sure if it's out of warranty now, but I would definitely return it for a different Chromebook if I could.
