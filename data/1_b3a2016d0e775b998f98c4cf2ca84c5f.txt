This laptop does have some problem with the graphics card. I dont know if its because of windows 10 but the graphics driver would stop working but recovers right away. It gets annoying because sometimes it would happem 2-3 times a day but it doesnt that often anymore. Overall the laptop is really good. Its fast and really light and the battery life is pretty good compared to many other laptops. The sound is okay but not as loud as mac, but it is good enough? Sometimes it gets hot if u play mid intense games if vent it, it should be fine. I dont know if theres a problem with the mouse trackpad but when i tapit twice, it wont double click anymore. It used to tho. If the keyboard has back light, it wouldve been perfect.
