Great laptop, no regrets with purchase!
I'm a loyal apple user; however, doing excel work on a Mac is rather difficult.  I needed a laptop that wasn't overly expensive, lightweight and did not crash with multiple excel tabs open.  This laptop does the job! I highly recommend this laptop to those who want a versatile laptop that can easily be carried around during commutes.Only problem is the track pad...I've had better, but still can't complain for the price!
