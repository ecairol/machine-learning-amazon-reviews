Been great so far!
My old PC is an i5, 8gb of RAM so it starts up pretty fast too; but i am still amazed with this machine's speed (4GB of RAM is pretty reasonable for this OS; please do not get the 2GB version). Loving the track-pad and all of its gestures (sliding to go back and forth, 3-finger-scrolling, 2-finger-scrolling; basically just like a Mac trackpad-- really convenient). Loving the keyboard, I like the feel when typing. The screen is the best of all, after having this baby I don't think I will ever be able to buy a laptop without an IPS display. Compared to Mac Retina screen, I seriously see no different, if not saying that the Chromebook screen is a little bit better and brighter. Thin and light-weight. I only own this baby for a month or so, but been loving it so far! Highly recommend this product! (if you don't need to edit video or photo, this can really be your primary machine!)
