Great Camera! Cyrstal Clear Video!
This is my first webcam since the old Intel Create and Share camera came out. Relative to a notebook cam, this thing is superior in every aspect. Running it with Skype Beta taking advantage of HD 1080p and its crystal clear. Mounts on a monitor easily and one can even place it on a camera tripod. It's just crystal clear as tested on Logitech's proprietary HD software and through the Skype beta (which has since magically disappeared from their download site). I was able to get the camera directly from Logitech before Amazon has it in stock.One thing I would like to see is full screen video, which seems to be limited on both Logitech and Skype's software.
