A whole new world of Netflix viewing
I have a 42 inch HDTV that in order to see Netflix, I've been forced to use a Wii connection.  The picture quality after going through the Wii is not great.  When I had the chance to upgrade to the Google TV box, I jumped at it.Installing the box is a breeze.  Connect via HDMI cable to the DVR/cable box and out to the TV.  Once installed, let the box find the home wifi, connect and you're ready to go.You have access to Netflix, Youtube and the internet on the biggest monitor I've ever seen.  Netflix comes in as HD and has great picture quality.  I've also used the internet connection to read some really big emails - LOL - fun but not something I'll be doing a whole lot.I think I've just really scratched the surface of what this thing can do for me.  I am just now thinking about accessing my preferred photo site, Shutterfly, and showing photo albums on the big screen.Really enjoying this so far and recommend it highly for ease of use and installation.***UPDATE 3/21/2013****Still enjoying the unit somewhat but am running into real issues with it overheating (I think that is what is wrong) and freezing.  The only solution is to unplug the unit, wait a minute or two and then plug it back in  before it will unfreeze.  Very annoying when it just seems to happen out of the blue.  I'm reducing the stars to 3 because this is a real problem and I don't think I can say it's great when I've been having all these problems.
