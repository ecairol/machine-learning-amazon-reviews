Diggin' It So Far
Really liking this so far. Received as a gift that I had picked out myself after consulting my brother on all the technical aspects of it. Definitely takes some getting used to when you go from a Windows OS and a local hard drive to the Chrome OS with access to the cloud to save everything. All aspects of this computer are done through the cloud. There is no saving or running programs from your machine - it's all internet based. Pretty cool because it means that you can access everything that's "on" your computer from anywhere. Only downside is that Chrome OS is NOT compatible in any way, shape or form with iTunes. Not a big deal to me since we have another Windows-based computer in the house and I can use that, but it might be an issue for someone if they are getting rid of their Windows-based laptop, going with a Chromebook and need iTunes.
