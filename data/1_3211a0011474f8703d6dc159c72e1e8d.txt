A pleasure to use if it is really what you need.
I ended up returning this since it had a keyboard flaw where the CTRL key did not work, and also because I determined that I really needed a Windows machine, even for on the road.  If you need websurfing, email, google docs, netflix and the like, and do not require "real" programs, this was light, functional, fast, and the price was great.  It is lightweight, and you don't feel concerned about traveling with it because it is so inexpensive.  Probably would have kept it as a second machine if it had not had the hardware error.
