So quite
Love this Zenbook. It is so quite, it is efficient for everyday tasks. I also have trouble staying connects to certain wi-fi. Noticed it only on campuses (noticed it on two university campuses in two different states, both of which I've never had problems with connecting to internet before this book). The battery life has been great, I've had it for 6 months. I will definitely be shopping for a solid state drive computer when it comes time to make my next purchase.
