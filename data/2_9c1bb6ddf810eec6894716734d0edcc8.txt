Overcame annoying 'tap'
Yup, I'd buy another. It did take a while to get used to the annoying click sound every time I tapped the 'mouse' pad. I tried to stop this by inserting paper into the space between the surface and the case. Did not work so I gave in and perfected my soft 'tap'. Everything else is fantastic.
