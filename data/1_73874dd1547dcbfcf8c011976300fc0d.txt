So-so entry level laptop
Was freezing and shutting down for the first month. Updated some of the software and it helped a bit. Still, it goes bananas sometimes and will freeze while doing something simple like streaking movies off Netflix. This is a laptop that is very entry level. A lot of proprietary software and not so easy to work with Windows 8.
