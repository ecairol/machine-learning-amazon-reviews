Great for the price, amazing PC for the basic consumer.
PROS:- price, unbeatable- specs are great, new baytrail processor is outstanding- great looks and the build quality is really nice- you can add another HDD into this laptop with a easy adapterCONs:- HDD is horrible, a ultra slow 500gb 5400 RPM drive bogs down Windows 8.1- Can't expand RAM, your stuck with your 4gb soldered onto the Motherboard- CD slot is usable but the chassis design makes this tough and ugly looking- my trackpad doesn't work after 6 months, but I've taken this apart so many times it's probably my fault.- Only a USB 2 and 3 ports on this machine, 2 USB ports total, it's 2015 people you need to have more, no ports on the other side anyway so much  room on the opposite side for ports, just lazy build quality there.- 720p screen, which is disappointing but I suppose cost savingCan't complain for the price this works well and the screen size is wonderful, if your a simple tech user, Facebook and Email and web browsing and office applications then this is perfect for you. DO NOT try to play the new COD whatever crap game on this, NOT A GAMING LAPTOP and it never will be the onboard graphics are measly at best and you can't upgrade it without spending a ton of money. It's good for the generic person so as long as your okay with the average specs and average usability then it works great.
