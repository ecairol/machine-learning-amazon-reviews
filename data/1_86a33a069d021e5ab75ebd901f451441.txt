Great for students
Got this laptop recently as a gift, and I'm very pleased with it. I've always had HP laptops, my most recent was the HP HDX16 and I've had it for a few years. Getting this little guy was a big change for me, but the change is a good thing. I'm a college student and I was never able to carry around my laptop efficiently because it was so heavy and big, but now I can! This thing is so tiny and light, it'll be easy for me to tote around campus now. The keyboard is something I still need to get used to though. Sometimes it can get a little bit laggy when there are multiple tabs or apps open, but nothing that annoys me and it doesn't interfere with what I'm trying to do. Overall, I really recommend this laptop to students who are needing something portable and efficient.
