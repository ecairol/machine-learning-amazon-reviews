So far quite happy
Just recieved yesterday. Out of box updated and updated to Windows10. So far so good. Just getting use to all bells and whistles as I have just come out of stone age using ancient Windows OS at work. Had to mess with sound settings a bit to my taste and use but that was easy fix. Video quality good and have had no issue with responsive speed or switching between apps or lag with multiple windows running. Start up pretty quick. Good bang for buck
