Great Bang For Buck In Regards to Performance And Build
This ultrabook is awesome. It is definitely a lot faster than I expected it to be. Especially for everyday tasks such as browsing, media consumption, etc. It can surprisingly run very light games as well, which is a huge plus. At this price point, it is definitely worth the great mobility it brings to the table in addition to the good build quality and overall performance.
