Feature description is a lie
This camera is touted as the premier model on this site and on logitechs own site, but much of the functionality listed is either crippled or eliminated entirely. All video effects are completely removed. No avatars, no effects, nothing. The camera will do 1080p, but at that resolution the options to do simple things such as mirroring the image to make left match left and such are locked out. You have to be at 480p or lower to use that simple thing.This is perhaps a great camera, but the software is crippled, and there is no option to download a previous version before it was crippled. I have sent an email to logitech and will update this review to include thier response if any. I suspect I will have no choice but to return the camera.Note: I checked the software on logitech site for this camera in other operating systems and video effects are removed there as well. I checked with other cameras on thier site and they all say the functionality has been removed from the software.DO NOT BUY if your intention is to use this functionality.UPDATE: I received a reply from Logitech. They say that the older version of the software will not work with c920, that their website shows that the camera does not support the effects, and they sent me a link to a technical spec sheet which shows video effects as N/A. I sent them a screenshot of their website which shows the c920 as the premier camera for video effects, as well as the table on this listing which shows it as the premier for video effects. I also found an older version of the software, LWS240, which in fact DOES support the c920 camera and it is able to use video effects.I have no idea why they are mucking about with this software. It is plainly capable of working as evidenced by 240.Not pleased.
