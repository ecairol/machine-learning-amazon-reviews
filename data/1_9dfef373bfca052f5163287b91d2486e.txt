Good Camera
I borrowed the C910 version of this camera from my neighbor and really liked it so I decided to purchase the newer version. The C920 picture quality is much better. I compared them both side by side, and the C910 picture looks darker and less clearer. I really like this camera and I use it often for Skype. I would of preferred to have an installation CD included then going on the website. I had an issue with the smart installer (its not very smart!) so i was forced to use the full installer and everything went smoothly. The microphones on the camera are great too. They pick up sound extremely well. This camera is much smaller than the C910.
