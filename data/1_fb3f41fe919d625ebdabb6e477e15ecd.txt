Summary of Computer
The computer is fairly heavy, and the size isn't compact. In the good side, itis made of a decent plastic, and sounds hallow on the inside. The design ispretty good, and the performance is acceptable. It's not the fastest computerI've seen yet, but still makes a decent computer to use. And it's packed with thelatest version of windows.
