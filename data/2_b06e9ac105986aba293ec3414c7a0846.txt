Good laptop
Overall good laptop.  I was debating this machine vs the UX303 (http://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Zenbook-UX303-13-3-Inch-Laptop/dp/B00S44HXRW/ref=pd_sim_147_6?ie=UTF8&refRID;=04YMSNA23YNRNTQN3WWS).  Biggest concern on the UX305 was the 'M' processor since it's meant to be for light duty use vs the powerful core i5, but after using it as normal, I see no issues with its speed to this point.The biggest drawback on the UX303 is the computer is much thicker than the UX305.  The UX305 itself has a nice screen, good keyboard and semi-decent trackpad.  The trackpad sometimes doesn't respond on the two finger click or the scroll, but really Apple is the only one who got a trackpad right the first time.  The keyboard is responsive and the battery life is outstanding.The machine itself is extremely thin less than a macbook pro and just about the same as a macbook air.  The lip of the screen doesn't really come out that much so it's a two handed opening which is not a big deal, but i'm not sure why the engineers didn't just adjust for that.  Oh well.  The other users are right on the backlit keys.  I guess once you get used to them you overlook how good that feature is and with this Zenbook, it does definitely get hard to see the keys at night.  The dark aluminum brush on the laptop doesn't help I'm sure.Overall I gave it 4 stars.  The wifi card needs tweaking to get AC speeds, the trackpad is average at best, the bottom of the laptop gets hot when under load, and the keyboard is a little hard to see.  However as said above, the 'M' processor seems to hold up so far to everything I've thrown at it.
