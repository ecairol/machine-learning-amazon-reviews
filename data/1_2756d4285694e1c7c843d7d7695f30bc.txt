There is a lot I liked about the ASUS C300 and would rate it 3 1/2 stars if I could.  I ended up returning it for a couple of really kinda minor issues.  1)  The edge of the laptop where your wrist rests is not rounded and I found it uncomfortable to use the keyboard and trackpad for extended periods of time. I was constantly trying to find a comfortable position to rest my wrist.  2) The other issue was network connectivity.  It didn't always find the network and would have to go into settings to find network. This was never an issue with any other wireless device I own so was a bit of a concern.  Not sure if this is a ASUS or Chrome issue, as this was my first Chromebook.There are a lot of positives about the ASUS.  Battery life is incredible. Boot up time is fantastic.  It has an excellent trackpad and I found the display completely acceptable for my use.  I really considered keeping it but with so many other Chromebooks coming out soon I decided to return and check them out.I will definitely be buying another Chromebook - Love the concept!
