Decent unit for the price. Has a few drawbacks.
I purchased this for school, as my classes require me to use Silverlight for some programs and to build SQL databases.  I prefer my Chromebook for general use.  It's not bad.  The only two real drawbacks for day to day use that I have found are the lack of a right click key (same as the Chromebook), which is a feature I do miss, and the built in camera, which is fine as long as you  don't breathe, move, or think about breathing or moving.  There is no optical drive, which is fine with me.  I work evenings so I make youtube stories for my youngest to watch with Mom, and I have to use her HP for those.  The keys are well spaced and it is a responsive unit, especially in this price range.  Played a few games on FB and it worked fine.  So for $249, no complaints.
