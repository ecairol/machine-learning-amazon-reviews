(Unfortunately) an Awful laptop
Really wish I would have payed more attention to the reviews on this laptop. I purchased this primarily to stream EPL soccer and cast it to my hdtv with the Google Chromecast. Unfortunately, this computer does not seem to have the processing ability to complete this meager task. In fact, I've never seen a computer operate as slow as this out of the box. To make things worse, starting this computer up, it indicates it has roughly 250GB of memory as opposed to the 500GB as advertised. Also the keyboard feels like a toy and is infuriating to type on.
