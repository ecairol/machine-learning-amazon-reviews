You get what you pay for, and that's good enough
You get what you pay for - low specs, but at a low cost.I'm a power user with a bulky desktop at home, but for portability, I prefer something small, cheap (nearly disposable), with lots of battery life.I've been using this Cloudbook for a few weeks, and it actually exceeds my expectations, which is even a surprise to me, as I was skeptical it'd be enough. I've had crappy atom netbooks, and other laptops with limited CPUs and RAM, and they were terrible, nearly unusable. While this Acer is slow, it's not brutally slow. Browsers today are massive memory hogs (I normally run FF and Chrome at the same time), but this thing can handle it. You're not going to game, but you can browse and watch Netflix, and putz around the OS without pulling your hair out.Don't expect to be able to use Readyboost even on the USB 3.0 port - W10 doesn't allow it.Windows 10 is a step in the right direction for the weight of the OS on resources. I desperately want Linux installed, but as of yet, I can't get Arch Linux to boot (The CPU is x64, FYI). Puppy Linux booted fine, but it didn't recognize the touchpad. I tried Ubuntu as well, and it'd fail to boot as well. Note there is a legacy BIOS option, and regular UEFI and Secure Boot (Secure Boot can be disabled after setting up a password to the BIOS).The battery life is around what is advertised and Intel gives some tools to modify it's power usage/performance.The body is strong. Plastic, and not averse to flexing, but it's more rigid than you would think going in.C:/ currently has 10GB free with all Windows 10 updates and a few applications installed.
