Disappointed.  Had to return the unit for repair right out of the box as the screen would work in only one position, changing positions blanked the screen.  Aside from Windows 8 being the worst of the worst for multiple reasons, the unit hangs when running Office.  I turned off the backlights on the keyboard, but maybe that's just me.  The keys don't always respond.  The touchpad is extremely irritating.  I hear many people rave about the machine being fast, I found it slower than my old Dell.  No recovery discs, no back up OS.  Won't buy another ASUS.  Mac is looking pretty good.
