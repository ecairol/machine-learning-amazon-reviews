Underpowered Bay Trail processor
I just bought one of these (the 4GB full HD model). I was very disappointed after running the Octane performance test a few times. This HP gets around 8,500. My much cheaper and much older 2GB Acer C720 Chromebook with a Haswell Celeron kicks it's butt with scores around 13,500. These HP Chromebooks have the "Bay Trail" version of the Celeron. Don't be fooled. Not all Celerons are created equal. The Bay Trail is an under-powered tablet-style chip. The HP Chromebook 14 is a fan-less design, because the Bay Trail does run cooler than the regular laptop chips. So it's silent. But you trade a lot of performance to get that.Update: I just decided to return this. While I initially felt the build quality was pretty good, I encountered two problems... 1) After switching to a dark wallpaper, I noticed a definite "screen bleed" in one of the corners where the backlight was leaking. 2) The battery drained almost entirely dead while the lid was closed overnight. I am under the impression that the thing should be asleep and not consuming power when the screen is closed.
