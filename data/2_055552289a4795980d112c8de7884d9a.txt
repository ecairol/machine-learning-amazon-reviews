Broken Trackpad is common problem ... You pay shipping for Asus warranty repair.
Clicking on the trackpad does not always register as a click. Search these Amazon reviews for "trackpad repair" or "trackpad unresponsive" and you'll see that this is a common problem. In my case, the trackpad worked fine at first, but it started getting flakier and flakier until the trackpad became unusable. I called Asus for an RMA and got it fixed under warranty, but Asus makes you pay shipping, and supply your own shipping packaging. (For some reason, the RMA agent advised that I don't send it in the original box since they won't return the box, but I did anyway, figuring who cares if I don't get my box back.)Still giving it 4 stars because it's a great chromebook at a great price.
