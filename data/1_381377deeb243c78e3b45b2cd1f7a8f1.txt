Very pleased with this device
I am very pleased with this device. It is thin and gets around 6 hours on a charge. I do not use the touch screen or tablet mode all that often. I tried it but it is a little heavy to be used as a tablet. Tent mode is a nice feature if you are running low on table space. The keyboard is a bit sticky sometimes though. I wouldn't recommend this for someone who does a lot of typing. You might want to opt for the 13 inch Pro version instead since it has a full size keyboard. This computer does what I need it to which is browse the web, watch videos online and casual photo editing in Adobe Lightroom.
