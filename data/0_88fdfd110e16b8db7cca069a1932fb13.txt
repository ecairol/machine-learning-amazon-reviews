BAD, NOT A GOOD PRODUCT
It's really bad. The wifi signal is never full, it's very hard to get connected. Even my old phone has a full signal. Sometimes it even cannot search any wifi. And the second day I got it, it already crushed down, I was forced to turn down the power. The trackpad is like a s***, you can't use it to do anything easily. The battery life is not 12 hours, even if I use battery saver and only use it to surf website and do some light work, no video. 8 hours on top, and it concludes 2-3 hours in sleep mode.
