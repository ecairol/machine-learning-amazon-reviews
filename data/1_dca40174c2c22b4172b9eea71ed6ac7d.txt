I like it.
This laptop is fast. I like how lightweight it is. Even though it is lightweight, the computer's body still feels sturdy. Although it is fan less, it does not over heat. No Microsoft word. If you want to update your resume, you'll have to dish out $8 a month for Microsoft office (which is outrageous). One problem I had with this laptop was that it would crash while watching youtube videos on google chrome. This issue has been resolved. I guess an update fixed it. Does it really last 10 hours on a full charge? It's more like 7,8 hours . One thing that really sucks about this laptop is the extremely low speakers. I always use headphones so this doesn't affect me much, but anyone without headphones will be frustrated. 1080p videos stream flawlessly on my 25mbps internet. The display is beautiful.  The touchpad is alright, but the right and left button are so rigid and loud clicking. This computer shuts down and boots up within a matter of seconds.
