Nice little internetting machine
THIS IS NOT A MAC OR WINDOWS COMPUTER. For all of you wondering. It is a chromebook, it's main storage is online, and no you cannot get programs such as word or powerpoint. This is a good little internetting computer. I purchased it for an online class (that I mostly use google docs/drive for) and it works great. I haven't had it for too long, but so far it's been awesome, the only annoying this about it is that there is no caps lock button. Which  I'm sure for most people is fine, but that's what I always used - instead there is a search button that brings up like a quick search thing on chrome. Once you get use to it, it is actually kind of handy, but bothersome at first.UPDATE: I've had this computer for a few months now, and I am still really liking it. BUT I finally needed to print something today. I had heard that it would be a hassle to print, but this is just ridiculous. First you need to have the right kind of printer, and then you have to set up the printer, which sounds easy, but it won't find the printers it is supposed to and none of the directions I have found actually work. And it says that my printer should work with the "cloud print" but it doesn't. This is honestly the most obnoxious thing and I thoroughly hate the printing options this computer has.
