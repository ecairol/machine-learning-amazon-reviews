Decent machine for this priceline
Bought this as a Christmas gift for my seventeen year old daughter and for what she was looking for, it's been good. We had issues at first getting the volume to work. I kept messing with the volume controls and even though everything had been turned on and was looking like it should be good to go, no sound.  After a couple hours, the sound just popped on and has been working fine since. Weird.She primarily uses it for facebook, Netflix and Youtube.  No other problems yet. Now that the sound actually works, it has good volume.
