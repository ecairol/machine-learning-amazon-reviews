Terrible product- do not buy
I received this computer on June 17, 2015 and immediately had problems. The WiFi kept cutting out and saying there was no internet connection even though the signal on my desktop was strong and worked fine there. It regularly froze while attempting to upload my music into iTunes and the few times the internet worked, it was too slow to actually do anything. After multiple attempts to fix the issues, I decided it was easier to just return it, get a refund and find something better. Don't let the good price fool you- this computer is not worth it!
