Horrible laptop. It was working fine for few days but later started getting all sort of software problems. Display drivers stopped and recovered again and y'day it collapsed totally. We could not even boot the laptop but after a while it started. This is the first laptop where I see too many problems -within 2 weeks . Even the screen gets dim at one corner. I will not recommend this to anyone.
