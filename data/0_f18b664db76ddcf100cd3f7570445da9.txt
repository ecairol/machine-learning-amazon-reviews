Had 3 months, will not turn on.
Bought the laptop for my grandmother who used the computer to go only on the internet.  She had the laptop for only three months and it is already not working.  When the computer is opened, the screen will not turn on.  If it is opened at the top very slightly, as if it is almost closed, the screen will turn on.  It really cannot be used this way.  Want to return it and have a new one sent, however, it is past 30 days.  Would not recommend.
