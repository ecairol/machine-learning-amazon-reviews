A Piece of Junk...
A piece of junk. I agree with everyone who trashed it, it is the worst laptop I've ever had. Not sure if it's the computer that is the problem, or the Windows 8.1, but it frequently freezes when I'm on email or in a WORD document. I am not streaming video, or doing anything taxing whatsoever.Beware, my friends.
