Non-existing customer service -- back to Boxee Box!
Please note: I am giving 1 star because there is no -1 rating!I am current Boxee box customer; as many of you know the  Boxee box support & production was discontinued almost a year ago. After 2 years of being relatively happy Boxee box customer, I felt that my cable-cutter needs replacement now; and found relatively positive reviews for Hisense Pulse. Why not give it a try?Packaging: the unit was packaged nicely, however mild disappointment was caused by the fact that there were at least 3 Manuals all telling slightly different things.Setup: the unit started setup as soon as it was plugged in. Unfortunately, pairing of the keybord remote and the unit failed.Troubleshooting: I tried the steps from the Manual. First of all, the unit never went into the "Apps" menu. Second, "Step 7" referred to in the Manual, was not in the Manual!Customer service: After 20+ attempts of pairing, I call the number mentioned in the shipping package. First, the Customer Support menu does not have appliance. Second, after I got thrugh, I got a pleasure to talk to CSR either sick or under unfluence or both at the same time. I was told that they do not provide troubleshooting over the phone. If I wanted to, I could send the unit back for repair or replacement (and I guess never see it again). But first, I need to email the proof of purchase. The address I was given sounds phony (lovely.c@hisense-usa.com). So I've chose to return it back to Amazon, to minimize the losses.Conclusion: avoid Hisense Pulse!!!
