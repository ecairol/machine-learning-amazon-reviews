Bad Bad Bad Apple
I am sure it is not the sellers fault since they cant see what is inside the box before they ship it. I blame apple. The Ipad I received ran into a software update corruption in the first hour of running it. I tried to update the IOS soon after i received it and got the iTunes logo attached to USB cable. What ever i did the Ipad would not start. It kept going back to the same iTunes with the USB cable logo.I connected with my PC and turned on iTunes and the updated kept giving unknown error and stopping. I left it over night and suddenly the Ipad started working.Also the Charger became "Hot" not warm (i am not exaggerating), when i first charged it. It has done this several times and its intermittent.VERY very disappointing. This is my first Ipad and was a gift for my mom.
