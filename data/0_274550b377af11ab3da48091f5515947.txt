DON'T DO IT! Infuriating touchpad!
I did a LOT of research before buying this, and was convinced I was going to love it. And I kind of did, for a while.But - in case you haven't heard - this laptop has the most INFURIATING touchpad you will ever use.It is VERY difficult to control the location of the cursor. You notice this particularly when you have carefully highlighted some text (for example), and you lift your finger off only to find that doing so has caused an entirely different block of text to become highlighted instead.The "button" area of the touchpad is so sensitive that the merest roll of your fingertip as you lift it off will make a mess of what you're trying to do. I'm constantly deleting text I didn't mean to. There are similar problems working in Photoshop.People have been calling for Dell to release a software update that offer a correction for this (perhaps the ability to designate the lower portion of the touchpad as "button only"?) but so far there's nothing, and there's no aftermarket software solution either.Seriously - This SHOULD be a great laptop, but if you can't use it without tearing your hair out, you'll just end up having to buy a lot of wigs.
