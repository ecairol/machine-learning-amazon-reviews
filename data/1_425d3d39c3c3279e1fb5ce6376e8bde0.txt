Love the light weight.  Not so crazy about the off switch location.
I bought this because of it's light weight and have not been disappointed.  I like the keyboard. I love the clarity of the screen.  However, I'd like to choke whomever put the tiny push button off switch exactly where one places their hand to pick up, push or straighten the computer.  In the six weeks I've had this machine, I've accidentally put my computer to sleep at least 50 times.  A small slide over the switch would have eliminated the problem.  Also, the power cord could have been six inches longer.
