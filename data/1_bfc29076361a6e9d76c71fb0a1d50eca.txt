but would be nice to get honest advertising
Computer is okay, bought this to have another computer to use. I purchased as an Amazon Warehouse Deal, it knocked about $60 off the original price, due to "packaging damage". Box had been opened but everything was untouched inside. My only complaint in this is they advertise a 500gb hard drive. I checked mine once I set it up, and only found it having a 250gb hard drive. The computer is a decent price, but would be nice to get honest advertising. Would give more stars but Hard Drive was not as advertised.
