Excellent ultrabook for the price.
I got this to replace an older 11.6" Acer Aspire 1410 for my wife. She insists on lightweight so she can take it wherever she goes. This computer is excellent - extremely lightweight for the screen size, beautiful display, and plenty fast (given the large amount of RAM and SSD). The processor is certainly not the fastest, but good enough for web browsing, MS Office, Kindle, music, video, etc. Construction is solid. The laptop fits easily in Amazon's 13" laptop sleeve. It comes with a USB-Ethernet port adapter.A few minor cons (and hence the 4 stars): It may be slightly hard to open for those with "fat fingers" - the lid overlaps the bottom a bit, so there's no clear leverage when opening the lid in the front. There is no dedicated number keypad. The battery is not swappable. The plug is located directly on the power brick, so you need extra room on the power strip to plug it in.Summary: The price is superb for what you get with this laptop and I would definitely get it again. (I have a MS Surface Pro 3 that is blazingly fast, but almost twice the cost.)
