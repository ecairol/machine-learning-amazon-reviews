ASUS 15.6-Inch Dual-Core 2.16GHz Laptop, 4GB RAM & 500GB Hard Drive
The battery life on these laptops are incredible.  Several times I have tested out how long it lasts while watching Netflix without the power connected and it seemed like I went several nights (watching an hour long show) and days (surfing the net and day to day productivity) without having to plug it in.  This is with the HDD.  I would assume that when I replace the HDD with an SSD that it will last that much longer.Intel's baytrail CPU is exceptional.  For day to day productivity use it definitely keeps up (Microsoft office, Netflix, web browsing, etc.)The first downside is the screen resolution.  I would really have liked to see Asus offer the same model with a 1080p screen for a little more.  I would have paid $50 more for the higher resolution... but from what I could tell there was no offering.  You would have to pay the premium for the better screen resolution.Also, omitting the optical drive tray is not at all a bad thing, however, I would have designed the laptop to be a little more thin since that space wasn't going to be utilized to house a "stock" optical drive.  I know it was cheaper for Asus to just use their existing case and omit the optical drive but now it looks like there should be one there but there isn't because we wanted the cheapest laptop.
