Unreliable
This was bought as a gift. The notebook worked fine for 6-months then the screen went blank. Sent unit in for factory warranty.  Turn around t8me was impressive, but it had the same problem.  I just sent the notebook back for the third time for the same problem and have spent an additional $100 sending it in for factory warranty.  I will not buy another ASUS product.
