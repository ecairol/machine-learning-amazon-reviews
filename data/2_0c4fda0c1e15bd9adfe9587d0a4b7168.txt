Amazon Warehouse Deals had some great deals, but my son didn't want that
The price on this laptop changes, I paid about sixty dollars less than it is currently selling for just a few days ago ($219), so I am going to take off a full star on my rating, because part of the reason I rate it so highly is the value equation, which drops at the current price of $275.For the price I paid this is an incredible value. It isn't a top of the line machine, but it is more than capable of day to day mundane tasks, and unlike a Chromebook doesn't have an extremely limited OS. I was hesitant about the lack of optical drive, but got over it quick, I Haven't bought a movie on DVD or Blu Ray in over a year, and I can't think of any software that isn't a download and enter code system.I bought it for my son to start college with, I was going to get him a 14" Alienware, Amazon Warehouse Deals had some great deals, but my son didn't want that, he wanted a basic machine, not something he would get tempted to play games on while in class, this machine fits the bill.I went through it and deleted a bunch of bloatware, but it doesn't seem like the bloatware was hampering performance much, and the HDD is plenty big enough that he wouldn't have missed the few extra GB it took up.So far he has used Office and done some web surfing and movie watching on it, and it is more than up to the task.It isn't a blazing fast computer, but it is not dog slow either. If you can pick it up at $219, you won't find a better deal on a new laptop, at $275 you might want to look for something with a Core i3 and an optical drive and maybe even another couple of GB of RAM for another $25.
