Great value for a high quality laptop
Computer was ordered for girlfriend who will use it for work - MS Office and internet mainly. The laptop seems to have a quality build and feels sturdy. The screen is not as vibrant as her 2010 macbook pro, but I think it looks very crisp and nice. The speakers are not as loud as the old macbook also, but they are fine to watch a youtube video here and there. As for performance, it opens Word and Excel quickly and seems to run them without any problems or lag. The same goes for internet browsing on Chrome and IE. As some other reviewers have mentioned, the color is not actually black or grey. When in the light, it appears to be a plum purple color. My girlfriend likes this very much. In low light it's hard to tell that it's not just a dark grey/black. With three usb 3 ports, sd card reader, and micro hdmi out, there is plenty of connectivity. The overall package, especially considering there's 8GB ram and 256GB ssd, is an extremely good value. The quality overall is not quite at mac level, but you'd have to pay hundreds more for less ram and smaller ssd. I ordered this pc from the microsoft store which had a $100 off promo code, so for $600 plus tax the value is unbeatable.
