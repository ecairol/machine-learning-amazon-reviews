Great Chromebook
I was given this Chromebook as a gift from my father. I'm a software developer, and part-time writer, and needed something that was extremely portable with a long battery life. The C201 hasn't disappointed. It is incredibly light, and the battery lasts around 8 hours with steady use. The keyboard has a great feel, and the screen pops with vibrant colors.If you are going to buy this, though, you should educate yourself about Chrome OS and the limitations of Chromebooks. The offline usages has improved a lot since the first generation of Chromebooks, but functionality is still limited.
