This Chromebook is awesome. When firing it up you literally just log into your g-mail account. The build quality is nice, it is light weight with a large screen and it is excellent to have a full keyboard. Keep in mind with Chromebooks it is all web based so you don't have the full operating system slowing down the speed like a traditional laptop. Also HP has a similar model with 2 gbs of memory but for $30 more you can double it, such a great deal!
