Perfect for College.... but
My brother and I both bough one of these for college. It is great for in between classes, taking notes, studying, and surfing the web. It is pretty much perfect and has amazing battery life!The only reason for the 3 stars is a POOR MANUFACTURE ERROR. The rubber stoppers on the frame of the screen are too short and cause the keys to rub against the screen. This is not only mine either, my brother's does it too! It leaves dark grey marks all over the screen and I have to clean it everyday if I don't want that. I really hope that the keys don't end up causing indentations into the screen and permanently ruin it.... if that does end up happening this purchase will not be worth it.
