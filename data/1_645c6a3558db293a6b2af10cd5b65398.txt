Got this notebook last night and how its super lightweight.  I have a MSI GT72 gaming laptop and needed something light to travel with and listen/watch videos ect just basis usage.  So far I don't see any dead pixels like some reviews say.  Wi-fi connection is great.  Been connected to 5gz wifi in my home and so far so good.  The track pad isn't that bad to be honest.  I can't see why people complain about to damn much but for me I have small hands and works great for me.  Very responsive to the touch lol.  I would give it 5 stars but need more time to play with this bad boy.
