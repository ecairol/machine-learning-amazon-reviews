Time to get rid of those old PC's!
Great little computer. Battery life is amazing. Hated old PC and it finally died so needed something to replace it with. I haven't used google documents much before but have loved being able to use word and excel without having to buy windows software. I don't like that there isn't a right button on the touch pad, I'm having to figure out spelling without immediate auto correct. Learning chrome but loving it so far. I'll update later once I have a better handle on this thing!
