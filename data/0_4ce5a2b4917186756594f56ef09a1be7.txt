Broken after 5 months
After owning the laptop for 5 months, the touchpad is broken. Asus will repair it for 'free' after an hour phone conversation. It shouldn't have broken after such a short time of ownership. It's going to take 7 days to fix, and I have to buy a box that will fit it. I have had a few chromebooks and none of them have broken like this.
