It's pretty much the bigger version of the Zenphone 2, and that's not a bad thing. Like how the Zenphone 2 is like a cheaper somewhat better iphone replacement. This is like a cheaper better Mac-book air. I highly recommend buying this laptop for web browsing and possibly light light gaming, like mine craft maybe. All in all a great laptop.
