One of the best laptops that I've owned
One of the best laptops that I've owned. Design is awesome - as thin as it gets. Weighs nothing and really great performance. (I just hope that Win10 is an improvement over the current dog that Microsoft is having us walk).  I would buy this laptop over and over again. I love using it - that's saying something for this crusty old MS Dos fan.
