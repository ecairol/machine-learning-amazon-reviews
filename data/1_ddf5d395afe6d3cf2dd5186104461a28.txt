Great hardware, but you shouldn't ship hardware without having drivers.
Note: If you want to hear about everything wrong with this laptop on linux, please look at my original review below. However, after nearly 20 hours of work, and basically writing my own touchpad drivers, here is my review of the XPS 13, currently running Deepin Linux.As I mentioned before, this laptop will not work very well (or at all, depending on how you look at it) on Ubuntu. However, Deepin has shown to be remarkably robust. The trackpad being on a rather abnormal bus threw it a little off from what I can tell, but not in any staggering way.Worst:Dell themselves. Any company shipping hardware without having prepared binary drivers is incompetent in the worst degree. Regardless of the fact that I have gotten it working, I had to do most of Dell's job for them, and they should feel pretty bad about that, if they don't already.Bad:The keyboard still occasionally glitches out slightly, although the depth and resistance are pretty good, and the trackpad performance can be slightly coarse, but it isn't too bad. An external mouse solves this perfectly.The wireless drivers that I managed to install are pretty bad. This goes back to the "Dell shouldn't produce hardware without drivers." thing from earlier, but it's still really annoying.Good:The speakers. I was a little worried about side speakers, but these babies are awesome. They are so small, and yet they actually can put out a lot of sound. The bass is actually much better than I expected, although obviously it can't compete with even a twenty dollar pair of speakers. Notably, the speakers are the fastest way to deplete the battery, possibly as much as 20-30%/hour. Headphones will likely double your battery life if you are an audiophile.This laptop is also surprisingly powerful. I came from a 3820QM, which is still one of the fastest processors on the market today, and while this one is not as fast, the difference is marginal for the purpose of coding.Battery life. This morning, I looked down and realized that the battery life was at 14%, and I was disappointed. Then I realized that I had been programming for over 8 hours, and that I had just had a lot of fun coding. Not a bad sign for both usability and battery life.Best:The screen. This thing is gorgeous. 3200x1800, and it also manages to be extremely bright. on half brightness, I can still read this thing outside on a sunny day. It's actually incredible. Colors are incredibly vibrant, and I can safely say that I have never seen a better display (and I've seen a lot of 4k and UHD displays before now).Design. This is a beautiful laptop. There is nothing I can say that I hasn't been said before, but it is gorgeous.Bottom line: Dell is a horrible company, and they should be ashamed of their shody software. However, they have managed to produce the most elegant laptop on the market, with a lot of positive traits. I would give this laptop a 5/5 if I were on Windows, but I can't use Windows, and I feel that a 3/5 is being more than generous on Linux. When they release an updated sputnik kernel and drivers that I can use on a 9343, I will update this review.*************************************************************I sit here struggling to write this on my new xps 13. Originally, this review sounded like The Wolf of Wall Street, where I repeatedly told Dell to go f**k themselves. However, that seemed unlikely to get published.For a little back story, I got the i7-5500 version with 8GB of RAM, the 3200x1800 resolution, and a 256GB hard drive. It looks beautiful, and it's really light weight. Needless to say, I immediately swapped out Windows for Ubuntu, and proceeded to boot up the machine. The first thing that I noticed was that everything was scaled poorly, but the fault for that lies with Ubuntu. The second thing that I noticed was that the trackpad did not work properly, often freezing, confusing gestures, and just being a miserable pain. The third thing that I noticed was that the keyboard occasionally just repeats a character 50 times. (The start of that "Needless to say" sentence above was originally "Needddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd".) The fourth was that the screen occasionally flashes to black, and will not correct itself until I reboot. Those last three are all on Dell.Do not buy this computer. If for no other reason then to send Dell a message that they shouldn't ship hardware without first creating things like drivers, please do not buy this computer.And finally, to Dell: You have let me down this time. You should be ashamed of yourselves, and if I weren't going to go out to the gun range this weekend to put a couple dozen rounds through this piece of sh*t "laptop," I would be returning it. In the future, don't ship hardware unless you have drivers for that hardware. I will never buy from you again.
