Extremely Slow
I bought this laptop for my MBA in Singapore and I am hating it since the very beginning. It is extremely slow, even while writing in word, the letters take a while to appear on the screen. The "Start Menu" icon does not work and the connectivity to internet doesn't work properly. Some times the computer shows limited connectivity to internet and I have full connectivity on my iPhone and ipad. I really want to return it but I do not know how to do it since I am at Singapore. Does any body knows if I can return it from here?
