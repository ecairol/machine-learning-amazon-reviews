IPad Air
I am not sure why this happens but when I am on Facebook the IPad will go back to the desktop. This happens whether it is in the case or not. Also, I can rarely play a video clip without resetting and even after resetting the video sometimes does not play.This is an expensive computer and I am very disappointed. I like my other iPad better.Now, less than a year from purchase, the glass has shattered for no apparent reason. Not happy at all with this product.
