My files disappear The sound is terrible. Scrolling is terrible
Do not buy a chromebook.  All it does is surf the internet.  My files disappear  The sound is terrible.  Scrolling is terrible. For a long time it insisted that I was in Guatemala and would not change to English.  I guess Google finally spied on me enough, figured my address, and took it upon themselves to change it for me.  It was a waste of money.
