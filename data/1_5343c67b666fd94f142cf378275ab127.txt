Seems Like Worse Picture Than 910
Have used this for a week now.  One thing I notice is that Video SNR seems poorer than what it was for the 910.  Still photos look good because of the higher pixel count but video performance appears to have degraded. The camera body  is also significantly smaller than the 910.  It also seems that objects in the background are slightly out of focus as compared to the 910.  All in all a step backward.  One positive is that the camera can be tripod mounted and the clamp has been redesigned to work better on a wider variety of monitors.
