It is fine for watching netflix and getting gmail
It is fine for watching netflix and getting gmail. The speakers are ridiculous. Can barely hear things at full volume.And it's not as high def or nice as the kindle screen. Can only view from directly straight on. I still use my kindle to play back on my bigger TV.But for the price, it's usable. I was hoping it would suffice as a workhorse, but still going to need to buy a new computer later.
