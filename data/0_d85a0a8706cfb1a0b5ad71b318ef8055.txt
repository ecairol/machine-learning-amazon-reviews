You pay for what you get.
I'm fairly disappointed in this product because it can't handle basic processing functions in a reasonable amount of time. Want to click on an article in your facebook feed? It's going to take 45-60 seconds to load. Want to open up Word to write a memo? Hit the bathroom after you double click that icon and maybe it'll be ready for you by the time you get back. Not sure if I just got a lemon, but this doesn't feel like 4GB of RAM.The mousepad and buttons are also pretty shoddy. Overall, I'm not happy with this but I guess it's my own fault for trying to go cheap and not spending an extra $100-150 on a legitimate machine.
