Great performance for not a lot of $$$.  I'd say buy two.
Very fine laptop for not a lot of $$$.Get an external USB CD/DVD drive if needed. I looped a movie DVD to test the battery under load, got almost 6 hours.Light, thin, has the 10-key which is nice. All the ports I want. Decent graphics. CPU is the weakest point IMO.BTW, the AmazonBasics 15.6 laptop bag and a AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse w/Nano go great with it.
