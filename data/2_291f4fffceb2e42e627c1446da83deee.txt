You are better off going bigger.
It is good for the price. If this is really the top of you budget then go for it, but don't think you are getting a deal. If you can afford something even 100-200 dollars better, like the low-range dell computers, then I would suggest waiting and going better than this. The speed is underwhelming, due to the Intel Celeron processer which is slow as molasses. but does have a disc drive which was cool. also, you can upgrade to Windows 10 which I happily did. the design is also really heavy and very thick. made out of injection-molded plastic and feels exceedingly cheap, the lid is especially flimsy. poor display that washes out at an angle quickly. not good for streaming movies or TV both because of the sad display and the weak processer. huge bulky lump where the battery is, so really takes up space in a backpack. better as a notebook pc for desktop use. if I wasn't a broke student and could afford something even a bit better I would return it, but as things stand I am stuck with it. All in all I would recommend doing yourself a favor and not buying this PC.
