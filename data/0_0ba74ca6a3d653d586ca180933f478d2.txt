garbage. buy something else
bought this 2 months ago for my son to take to school. the hinge is faulty and the display starts to degrade when opened. starts as small lines and eventually becomes unusable. asus tech support response? 'have you tried resetting the chromebook back to it's original state?  really? you think a reinstall/reset is going to fix a broken hinge/display? we will have to fill out an RMA and send it in. meanwhile the kid doesn't have the chromebook for school work (the school requires students to have one).  don't be fooled by the marketing...this thing is cheap for a reason.
