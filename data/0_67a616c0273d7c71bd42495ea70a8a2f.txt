This laptop was a complete waste of my money
This laptop was a complete waste of my money. I did not purchase it off of amazon but I do currently own it. Within a week of use I started experiencing blue screen crashes. My hardrive died within two months. Several months later it had another problem. It's so loud from trying to run everything, all you can hear is the fan blowing loud and the laptop burns up. Everyone says Asus is great but this is a disappointment.
