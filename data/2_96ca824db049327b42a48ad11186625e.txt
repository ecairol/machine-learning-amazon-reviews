All in all not a bad purchase.
Does what it is supposed to do. Did not realize it has no DVD-rom on board though.Just beginning to get the hang of Windows 8.I hope the UEFI works if I ever have to do a recovery. I very seldom use the DVD player on my other computers anyway so I dont really miss it.Viewing Netflix is ok,I believe I do detect some visual distortion in some high speed motion,but at htis price I could live with that and it may be possible to do some tweaking to improve that.All in all not a bad purchase.
