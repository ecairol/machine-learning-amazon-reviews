SHUT UP AND GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY.
Get ready, because you're about to knock your pretentious MacBook owning friends down a notch.I spent months shopping around before deciding on the Zenbook, and I'm here to tell you this is absolutely the best value of any laptop on the market today. I looked at every option imaginable, including the MacBook Pro and the higher end Ultrabooks, and this is absolutely the best option for the money. This has all of the internal features that a $1200+ laptop has, and absolutely nails all of the important aspects with the 8GB of RAM and a 256 GB SSD (which, unless you are trying to store the Library of Congress on your laptop, is plenty of space). It omits things such as a touchscreen and a backlit keyboard in order to keep the price down and still offer top notch internal specs and build quality, which for me, are things that fit into the category of "cool" but don't improve the computing experience. The screen is beautiful and the matte finish is such a nice touch. The body is slim, lightweight, and just sexy. No way around it.  The core M processor is fantastic, and is going to be a very common place going forward.I can't say enough about this computer. Having nearly the exact specs of a $1499 MacBook Pro, at $699 this is highway robbery. Quit shopping.
