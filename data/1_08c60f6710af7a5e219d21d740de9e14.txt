Used for a month, impressed so far.
I got this specifically for networking field work, tech break/fix, etc. When I first opened it up I was in awe at how thin it was. It is basically, from a form factor and hardware perspective, a new (2015) MacBook Air that is not running OSX.I initially ran into some issues with updates for Win8.1 and ended up waiting a LONG time to take action on the machine, avoiding any unnecessary shut downs that could cause corruption across the updates.  After about 13 hours, I was still getting a busy cursor, so I did a ctrl+alt+del and just logged off.  It didn't cause any issues, just needed to run updates again.Display: 1920x1080, The screen is a non-glossy finish so glare is not an issue.Speed: Start up is around 10s from post.  not too shabby  Runs all the programs I need for work really well.Wifi: pretty quick...getting 866M/b consistentlyEth: comes with a 1Gb Ethernet dongleCharge: I've had it unplugged for about 9-10 hours consistently watching youtube vids.  Pretty nice.HID (Trackpad/KB): The keyboard feels good.  The PC is so thin that I feel like I'm going to type through the machine. lol  The trackpad is pretty sensitive, but is ok with me.CPU activity: There is no CPU fan because of the CORE m features, and to be honest, it makes me anxious, but it doesn't seem to require too much ventilation.  There is no noise, and no performance degradation.  Impressive.There is a lot of bloatware on the machine, but the ASUS Live Update, and Win BIOS Update are handy.I've been running with this machine for about a month, and I have had no issues with it except for the initial updating problems.  I give this laptop 5/5 and will probably get a couple more for personal use.  That is a lot coming from a dedicated Mac user. :)
