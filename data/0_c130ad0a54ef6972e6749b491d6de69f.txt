Good computer once you get used to it
Good laptop, don't like the shiny screen and the keyboard could be a little better.  Until I got used to it I was typing the wrong keys.  The power plug outlet is on the left side of the laptop and it would be much better if it were on the back for it is on the same side as the three USB ports.  The plug for the ethernet cable is also on the left side so if you prefer to use a mouse and you are a lefty, the cord constantly gets in the way.  The CD/DVD drive is very noisy quite often.  The battery life on mine is only a little over two hours and it is brighter when the cord is plugged up, more so than one would expect.  My old HP barely showed a difference when plugged or on battery power as far as brightness.  BE WARNED it does not come with a manual which I found frustrating.  You have to go online on the ASUS site to get the manual for it.  Hate the Windows 8.1 but managed to get it adjusted to work almost like Windows 7, thankfully.  After you get used to it and figure it out (if you aren't familiar with WIn 8.1) you'll find it a satisfactory computer and good for the price.  UPDATE! CUstomer service is of little or no help.  This has no battery that you can remove, they don't want to assist with the issue of a battery, you evidently cannot update this computer yourself in any manner.  If you need more ram, forget it.  DO NOT get an ASUS!!!!  After five months, the computer already seems to be wearing out.  The mouse pad freezes all the time and I have to reboot to get the pad or my mouse to work.  If you DO get an Asus, spend more money and get one that you know before you purchase it is upgradable.  I"m sorry I listened to my friend about getting one.
