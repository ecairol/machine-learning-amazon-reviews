Terrible WiFi detection
Terrible WiFi detection!!!!  Do not buy! It started working fine and within 5 minutes it started saying WiFi out of range when I was right next to my router. I know my WiFi was not the problem because none of my other devices were having issues and I don't have that many devices to begin with so it wasn't because I had to many devices under the same WiFi either...I was very disappointed as they were supposed to be Christmas presents and I bought 2 of them not just one .... :(
