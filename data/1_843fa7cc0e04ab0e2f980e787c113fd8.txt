For the money it is about as good as you can get
For the money it is about as good as you can get.  Windows 10 is a vast improvement over 7 or even 8.1.  I had no problems installing the software and getting the machine set up.  I did uninstall McAfee software and installed Eset Antivirus instead because Eset has much less code, which is a very good idea for a computer running a Celeron processor, and it also does a very good job of virus protection.
