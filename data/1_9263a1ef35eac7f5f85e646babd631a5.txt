which means it works much better than either of the Yoga laptops
Ordered 2 and both were defective (one was brand new and the other factory certified refurbished).  The new one had a bruised screen likely due to impact, while the refurbished one was very, very seriously too slow.  Also the brand new one was much slower than we expected; out of the box you would stare at the screen waiting for things to happen.  For less money we then bought a computer that was similar in size and features (Dell Inspiron i3147-3750s LV 11.6-Inch 2 in 1 Convertible Touchscreen Laptop) with close to the same processor: Intel Pentium N35230. The Dell LV so far works well, and is as fast as you would expect, which means it works much better than either of the Yoga laptops.From most of the reviews we were hoping for a good machine, but the slowness of both, and the defects made us worry that the Yoga lacked durability and might be too fragile.
