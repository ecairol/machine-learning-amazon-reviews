Ask for the recovery media before the warranty expires :O
I bought a Lenovo G460 3-4 years ago.  When the HDD died, I installed a new one, now needed to install Windows 7 on it - I had the product key.  When I tried to download it from MSFT website it said I should talk to Lenovo and get a installation disc.  I called them - the software support group - they want to charge $69 for sending me the recover media even though I have the license key.  They said had I called in the warranty period, they would have sent it for free.  I think it is not fair.  Who knew I have to be vigilant and ask for the recovery media before the warranty expires?
