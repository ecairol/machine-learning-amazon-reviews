Great laptop for students
This was one of the best purchase I have ever made. I use this laptop over my PC now. I was looking for a laptop to bring with me to and this is the perfect laptop. Lightweight and long battery life, not to mention its super fast. Don't let windows 8.1 scare you like it scared me initially. I almost never use the start menu where all the apps pop up and people get scared. There's a button where you click to go to the desktop and use it like a previous windows 7. The only downside that I've really had with this product is that my palms towards my thumb side tends to touch the trackpad while i'm typing and so itll click to wherever the mouse is. Somewhat annoying when typing long essays, but that could just be a personal issue. Overall a great product and I would highly recommend it.
