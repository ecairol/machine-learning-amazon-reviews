Almost perfect laptop
Almost the perfect laptop (other than the poor quality screen). Love the instant on/off, incredible battery life (10+ hrs). Simple OS. This is my 2nd chromebook and it is just about perfect. Wish I had held out for an IPS display though, the screen is really only good when looking directly at it - looking from any angle and it is washed out.
