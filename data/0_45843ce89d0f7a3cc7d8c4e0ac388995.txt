Terrible laptop
I bought this laptop last August. I had previously had a Mac for personal use and a Lenovo Thinkpad for work. When I got a new job I had to give my Thinkpad back to my former employers. My Mac is very old and does not work very well so since I had positive experiences with my Lenovo Thinkpad I purchased a Lenovo Yoga. Since I purchased this laptop I have been extremely disappointed. First off, the keyboard and touchboard seem like they are cheaply made and are very hard to use. I often rely on the touchscreen because I dislike using the keyboard and touchboard so much. Last week, less than 9 months after purchasing the laptop, my hard drive apparently crashed. When I asked the man at the Geek Squad how it crashed he said "it just happens, it can happen after 6 months or after 6 years". I lost everything on my computer; luckily, I did not have many important files (or any files on it all). In the 9 months that I have had this laptop, I use it maybe once a week, if not once every other week. I have not downloaded anything on it nor have I gone on any sketchy websites.  Thankfully, I bought extended protection so they will replace the hard drive for me. However, I would in no way recommend purchasing this laptop. It is probably the one thing I truly regret purchasing.
