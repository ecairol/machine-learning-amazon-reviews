super duper slow
super duper slow. I feel like i was duped and every time I try to use it I get frustrated with how long it takes to load anything. I can't even open up Chrome without it saying "(Not Responding)" It's a pain. I wish I never bought it. I searched for something to replace my Chromebook because I needed a computer that could do certain things that the Chromebook cannot. Yet, now all I do is use my Chromebook. *sigh*
