no word perfect, copy and paste sucks
remind me never again to get a chromebook. special printers, no word perfect, copy and paste sucks, no HD viewing. I could go on. there is a lot this thing doesn't do. I hate this chromebook. waiting patiently for black friday/cyber monday to get a new computer.
