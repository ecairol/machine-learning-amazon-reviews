Horrible product
Wow, just checked on this past order on this laptop, as I was just looking for the date of purchase - GREAT now it says on the description page of this thing (Old Version) there is a newer model of this item available.  Great I buy this piece of junk and 4 months later a newer version is out.  Go figure.  Anyone looking at this Asus laptop to purchase, seriously, look at another brand.  this thing is garbage.  keyboard and touchpad are clunky, especially the touchpad.  Slower than molasses.  Just did an Asus update on critical software, 1 update took forever, maybe the update will speed it up LOL.  What a waste of money this was.
