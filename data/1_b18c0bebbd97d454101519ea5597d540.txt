Not too shabby
It's not bad, the screen quality is decent, the speed is fairly decent as well. I knew that it was going to be a basic computer, it's primarily used for business, as I have to use the internet and Google is a decent enough company. I just wish that someone had told me that if you connect a printer to this computer, it will not work! You have to hook the printer to a regular printer and then you have to do all these other steps in order to have a printer with this computer, not to mention that I do believe that the printer has to be wireless. That's a huge pain in the rear, thankfully I can email important documents to people, instead of printing them out. So while this chromebook has fulfilled it's duties, there are times when it's super inconvenient, such as times when I want to open certain types of files, but because it's incompatible I cannot, certain websites that I may need to go on, thankfully there's only a couple, aren't compatible with Google Chrome...But overall, I would buy this product again. It's cheaper then a regular computer, not to mention significantly lighter and it does fulfill what I really needed it for.
