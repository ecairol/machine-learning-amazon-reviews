NOT buying another DELL. GOODBYE.
I bought this from the Dell website. I was never a fan of apple/macs and wanted to stick to my old favorite brands but that may have to change. Here's why:Cons:Weak wifi chip. (understandable due to size of laptop)Went into boot loop on me twice already. I had to use the built in reformatting to use my laptop again. (I bought this laptop in the beginning of Summer. It's only been 3-4 months. NEVER has a laptop of any other brand done this to me, especially when I'm not even using it heavily due to its small HD space.)HIGH PITCHED BUZZING/PROCESSING SOUNDS COMING FROM COMPUTER. It can get VERY ANNOYING.Oh, and bloatware. Survey will pop up on the bottom right asking you if you'd recommend a Dell. Guess what I had to say.Pros:Good travel size.Aesthetically pleasing.
