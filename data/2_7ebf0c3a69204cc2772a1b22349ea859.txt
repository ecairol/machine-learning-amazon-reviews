Great 1080p TV
I've never owned a ViZiO Tv before, I was always a Samsung kind of guy, but this TV is actually amazing not the best but pretty damn close. I got this TV mainly for my 6year old niece, which mainly watches TV at the moment, but good too for the future if ever wants to play games.The T.V came in the TV box which shows that it is in fact a tv that's one thing I didn't like I'd of liked it if maybe it was wrapped with more protection & or at least wrapped so you don't know what it was. The TV is in flawless condition; no dead pixels,no damage, & no scratches!Now that we got that out of the way, I'd like to talk about the TV itself:I googled a lot of information before choosing this brand of TV & they said out of all of the 40" TV brands of a 1080p TV, ViZio was the best. I can't really say if ViZio is the best tv to get if looking for a 40" tv but I can tell you it isn't a bad choice. I'm coming from a Samsung ES8000 46" and the only flaw that I don't like out of this TV is the clear action option which makes the screen darker, the black detail which makes the picture look like crap, & the active led zones which does about the same as the clear action which all of these settings can be turned off if not like which is a good thing. I played a few PS4 games on it and wasn't unhappy at all it runs fast and looks great with no complaints from me and I'm a serious gamer lol. Just like every other TV the Sun is a huge distraction. So, try keeping the Sun away from the tv or you won't be happy watching tv.Every TV I get I search for the best settings & then play around with it until I'm happy with the settings. For this TV, I went here:1.http://www.rtings.com/reviews/tv/lcd-led/vizio/e-series-2015& 2. http://www.cnet.com/forums/discussions/vizio-e-series-2015-picture-settings-642363/Then like I said I play with the settings. I like everything they suggested just I added more to the Backlight, Brightness, and color.My settings are:Picture Mode <Calibrated Dark>Backlight=100Brightness=62Contrast=80Color=60Tint=0Sharpness=10----------------------------More Picture>>:Color Temperature=COOLBlack Detail=OFFActive LED Zones=OFFClear Action=OFFReduce Noise=LOW for bothGame Low Latency=OFFFilm Mode=AutoGama=2.2-----------------------------------------Color Calibration>>:Red Gain= -2Green Gain= 1Blue Brightness=16\||\Offset=1----------------------------11 Point White Balance>>:10%: 8, 5, 720%: -14, -14, -1330%: -35, -33, -3340%: -30, -30, -3050%: -30, -28, -3260%: 0, 0, -570%: 0, 0, -580%: 0, 0, 090%: 0, 0, 0100%: 0, 0, 0____________________________The TV comes with 3 hdmi which I wish had 4 just because. Other things:USB,HDMI, & Audio out are on the side but opposite from the power cord.Behind the TV are 2 HDMIs, Ethernet, Component, & DTV.AS you know this is a smart TV and it has its own store to download more apps if would like to.TV remote is great it has a amazon video prime & netflix button just not sure why they didn't add a hulu one but instead they put a iheartradio which  pandora is better imo....The remote also has a smart home button which pulls up your apps..Some shows that have blackbars which I seriously hate, this TV has an option to stretch the screen which is lovely but only works on some not all depending on how the blackbars are positioned.I hope this was a helpful review not really sure of anything to add that could help anymore... So now it's up to you to decide if you want to buy it or not.
