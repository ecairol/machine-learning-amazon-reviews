I would buy a second one of these laptops.
I bought this laptop for my wife to use for email, games, and surfing the web. I was drawn to the price and I've had good luck with Asus products for years. I really like this little laptop (for what I wanted it to do). I do wish it had Windows 7, but I'm getting used to Win 8.1. The laptop is fairly fast, light weight, comfortable to use. The warranty is pretty good, and I've had good service from Asus in the past. My wife loves that it has a 10 key pad on the keyboard. The screen is easy to see and big enough for most light home users. We have had it about 3 weeks. I would recommend it to friends and buy another if I had similar needs for a laptop.
