Very dissapointed with the unit - lucky it's free given by employer
Not as good as it should be. Very heavy for 1 hand use. Battery doesn't last more than 2 hours for heavy office use and barely gets 4 hours watching movies with a Bluetooth headphone active. I live in South East Asia where average daily temperature is around 30 degree Celsius thus having this thing on the lap is extremely hot. The laptop itself heats up very fast and quite uncomfortable after a bit of use. The keyboard is nowhere near as good as my main laptop Carbon X1. I have small and nimble fingers and still find it very hard to use the keyboard precisely.The pen is very small and nowhere as comfortable as Surface's pen that I use in the office. The uncomfortable feeling of the pen matches my Note 3's pen, which of course I never use. I need to emphasize again that my hand's quite small and the pen feels small, not sure how people with large hands would feel, but I've seen my colleagues from Finland holding the pen like a toothpick, needless to say they don't use the pen either.On a final unrelated note: the virtual keyboard on Windows 10 doesn't automatically pops up when I need to type in table mode, which might have nothing to do with the laptop itself but operating system.My own conclusion: If you are lucky like me and work in the company that hands you these units for free, then use it and enjoy or hate it. However, if you have to spend money on it - DON'T. Buy a Surface or iPad.
