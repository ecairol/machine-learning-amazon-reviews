As much as I love google and it's safe search features
As much as I love google and it's safe search features. I would only personally use this a school or travel device. Things i really like about it is that you pay what you paid for, a very good price range for this laptop & most importantly the battery life gets a thumbs up. Things I dislike about this laptop is crosh, the buttons do not light up so when it's dark you can not type, the fact that it doesn't run windows in the first place & it's lack of material(this laptop scratches very easily).
