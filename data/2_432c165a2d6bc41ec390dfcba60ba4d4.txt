Fine developer laptop
I finally became sick of my old, heavy laptop. So I've researched many laptops online and in person at various stores. My top two choices were the Dell XPS 13 (2015 edition) and this Asus Zenbook UX305. My primary concern about the Zenbook was the processor. I am a developer and wasn't sure if it could handle my workload. I've been using this laptop for a few days now, and it's been performing great! Visual Studio 2013 is lightning fast. I've also used VMWare Workstation and the XP VM runs terrifically. I've loaded up many programs simultaneously and did not notice any slowdown. It's really great to have 8GB of RAM (which is a $100 upgrade for the XPS 13) and a 256GB SSD is more than enough. The XPS 13's screen looked great, but it wasn't worth a few hundred dollars more to me (since I would need to get the Intel i5 and 8GB upgrade). A few things of note:- I installed the Stardock Start8 start menu replacement program. Windows 8 is actually pretty good if you never go into the tile mode (which is pretty useless as a developer).- I deactivated Windows Defender. It was maxing out one of the CPUs (1 of 4), and I've never found much use for real-time virus protection if you know what you're doing :-)- So with the high-resolution and small screen, Windows 8.1 is pretty good at scaling various programs to make them bigger. Out of the box, it didn't work very well for VMWare ESXI Client, since I couldn't see the full remote desktop screen. So I found there's a setting when launching the program to not scale the program. So I can view the remote desktop at full resolution (but it's a bit small).- It would be nice to have one more inch of screen real estate (13.3" to 14"). But the 14" laptops are a bit heavier and aren't as great of value.- I prefer a real mouse over a touchpad. So I am using an Amazon Basics Wireless mouse, with the tiny USB receiver. I might consider a Bluetooth mouse since this laptop has a BT receiver.
