Good combo for travel
I recently purchased this at Best Buy and so far am very happy -- as it offers a lot for the price range.  My primary need is a machine for work/productivity-- answering emails, word processing, working with spreadsheets, web site maintenance and some light graphics work -- and I want two laptops -- so I purchased the Yoga as the machine I will travel with, carry to meetings, and of course as potential fallback in the event of problems with my primary computer.Features I like:* Very nice screen display -- large enough to get real work done,  good color & graphics for presentations or videos* Enough power to run Windows 8.1, 64 bit* Plenty of hard drive space* LOVE the hinge & different viewing modes.* Screen size:  it's larger than a netbook, but small enough that it is not completely unwieldy when folded into "tablet" mode.  It's also large enough to be useful for a table top presentation.Features that could be better:* Touchpad & Touchscreen are not as responsive as I would like. They work -- but sometime require gestures to be repeated.* Keyboard will take some getting used to (larger than a netbook but still smaller than a standard full size keyboard)* Exposed keyboard in tablet or stand mode: I wish the unit came with a light plastic snap on or slide on keyboard cover, to protect the keyboard from dirt or possible damage when not in use.* I'd rather have a somewhat smaller solid state drive - 500 gig is overkill on a machine this size, I would much prefer the same machine with a 120 gig SSD.* Battery life could be better.But given the price - I think this machine is a good buy.  I do find that it runs a little bit slowly -- there is often a noticeable lag when opening programs or apps, for example. I would not recommend this as a primary computer for anyone.  I chose this over an ASUS T100 Transformer -- but it was a close call.  I think that Lenovo Yoga is the best option for someone who wants a laptop that also has tablet-like features, particularly for business or workplace use - not so much for someone who  would be using their unit primarily as a tablet, with a keyboard needed for occasional use.
