Good for surfing the web
Bought this as a cheap replacement for my old PC which finally bit the dust in a devastating hard drive crash. Since I have my work-issued PC for heavy computing, I really just wanted something for browsing the Internet at home and on the go. I have an iPad but I don't like that it doesn't have a keyboard or the ability to dock and attach a monitor and mouse. So I went with a Chromebook instead of another laptop to save a few hundred dollars. This works well for what I wanted. I can tell the processor is much slower than what I'm used to on my work PC, however. Definitely can be a lag, especially with multiple tabs open. But it was a good buy, especially at such a low price.
