Wifi crashed, non removable battery, mousepad hard to navigate, MacAfee hogs CPU, windows 8.1 is hard  to navigate
Not too thrilled so far.  I thought I would give this brand a try but after only 1 week I feel like it won't go beyond the one year.The mouse/track sucks since you have to push all the time.  It feels like it's gonna break with all the pushing you need to do.  It's not easy to scroll.Yesterday the wifi didn't want to connect for some reason.  I got this for my daughter and it just crapped out out of nothing.  Had to shut it down and upgrade some windows upgrades for it to start working again.  No idea why it did that.  Don't think it will last long.The battery is build in! How the heck! Never seem that before.  How am I supposed to upgrade?I thought I was getting a cd rom but no, this one doesn't.Lastly, I think this is a windows 8.1 issue, it's just sucks.  It's hard to navigate.  Where are my programs? MacAfee is a joke.  It hogs the memory and slows down the CPU.  I had to uninstall since it kept asking me to buy it.  It's out and loaded Adaware which is free and have used before.
