Works just fine for how little it costs
You get what you pay for. Its not a top quality laptop, but for as cheap as it costs it works well and they put the quality into that part. The rest of it feels and looks cheap but hey...it works just fine! I bought this simply as a back-up laptop in case my nice Mac ever had an issue or for some reason I wanted a laptop to take somewhere that i wasn't worried if it got broken or stolen. But it works just fine and is easy to use. Yes it's a cheap feel but you get a lot for the little that it costs. Might be a great first laptop for a young person also or like myself as a back-up one. I don't really use it much but so far so good!
