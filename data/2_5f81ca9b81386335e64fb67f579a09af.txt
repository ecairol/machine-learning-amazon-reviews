Helpdesk engineer's review
I am a tier 3 IT helpdesk engineer, so feel free to take this with at least some credibility.  A lot of reviews complain about Windows updates hanging, or other operating system issues.  Off the bat, I need to remind everyone that Windows 8 is neither Lenovo's fault, nor problem.  Now, on to the review.Where I wouldn't necessarily recommend this for heavy duty use (e.g. video editing, multi-remote session log in, etc), this is probably the greatest laptop for home use I have used in...well as long as I can remember.  The only con is that you can't upgrade the RAM (it's soldered onto the motherboard and capped at 4 GB).  It is very quick and runs clean.  My favorite feature is stand/tablet mode.  If you fold the keyboard about 3/4 of the way back, it works as a stand and the touch screen goes into effect, activating "stand mode".  If you fold the keyboard 100% of the way back, it goes into "tablet mode".  The touch screen is incredibly accurate.  I don't know if this is what they were going for, but the laptop looks and feels a lot like a mac, in terms of physically/keyboard feel.  It weighs just under 5 lbs, so it feels like nothing.  The battery holds a solid 5 hour charge (tested this myself, including high usage and video streaming).And finally, the price.  I got mine for just under $500, all said and done, and expedited shipping.  This is an absolute steal for even $700, let alone $500.  I highly recommend this to anyone that needs a home laptop.
