It's ok for general light duty ...
I can't kick it too hard because its so reasonably priced. Its overloaded w apps I will never use and only comes w a 60 day McAfee protection so now Im fighting off the popup warnings. One of the popups froze the screen until I hit OK. I do not like Windows 8. Very diff to understand and maneuver. The computer itself has a cheap feel esp the keyboard. Im not a heavy user so its fine for me but maybe not for someone using it 4-5 hrs a day on multiple programs. Im satisfied but not impressed.
