No power system, but a great bang for buck.
I have deployed almost 300 of these units to clients, mostly schools.  This is a perfect model for this environment or as a lightweight (physically and technically) laptop.I also use one personally for my own use along with a MacBook Pro and a Lenovo laptop.  This is THE best machine for the money.This is a Chromebook and if you did not do your research beforehand then that is nothing besides the fault of the purchaser.  These run ChromeOS.  You can also side load Ubuntu and run Linux applications (also Steam) and install Wine within Ubuntu and even run Windows applications.  This does not do this out of the box though and takes a little patience and knowledge to accomplish but is not all that difficult if you put the time into it.I modified the internal drive from 16GB to a 128GB because I knew I would be loading Ubuntu and needed storage for that.  Replacing the SSD was not all that difficult if you are comfortable opening up a laptop and handling computer hardware.Only issue I have is that the cpu fan is a bit noisy. I really only notice this when I am in a very quiet room and is no louder then the Lenovo fan.  But hey, I spent 1/4 of the price of this thing on the CPU cooler for my desktop.
