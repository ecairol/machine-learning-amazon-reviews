The HappyOne convienently change their name to Buysmart hmmm...I wonder why???
It took me a little over a month to finally write a review on this Toshiba Laptop which happens to be a (piece of sh*t), because I wanted to be thorough in my review.I still use my broken old Toshiba laptop, which is falling apart, but far better than this garbage I bought. This laptop I purchased from a company through Amazon called "The HappyOne", within a few days of having it, I wanted to return it, but trying to do so The HappyOne were proving difficult, plus to return it they CHARGE YOU a %30 RESTOCKING FEE and S&H; also the ENDOWMENT EFFECT kicked in. As a matter of fact, upon writing this review, I noticed that the HappyOne convienently changed their name to Buysmart, which I find very suspicious. Worse $300 purchase I made in my life, you will probably regret it as well.Pros:It's a laptopIt turns onCons:Slow as hellFreezes like crazyA lot of junkScreens disappearA lot of faulty things wrong with it.
