Crap
The charger on my HP crapped out so I borrowed my fiance's Yoga 2 for a week while I waited for a new charger to be shipped. This thing is a piece of garbage! I don't understand how he can stand using it. The screen shorts out randomly and the audio jack doesn't work. When it's sitting on my lap it literally BURNS my legs! When you're typing the edge digs into your skin. To spite having the capabilities of a fast computer, it's slow. My HP which is supposed to be sub par is far superior to this in many ways. Glad I was able to test it out, I was thinking of buying one but not now. I will stick with HP.
