Great Laptop Overall, however the mechanical hard drive is a huge bottle neck.
Overall a very great computer I bought for 730 dollars.  I instantly replaced the 1TB mechanical hard drive with a 250GB SSD, however, so my speeds and boot times will be quicker then this computer would be "out of the box."Pros:Very quick and responsive.Backlit KeyboardGreat screenAmazing trackpad with gesture support (similar to macbook functionality)Cons:I came from a smaller computer so the keyboard is a little big for me so I'm getting use to the larger size of the keyboard.The 5200 rpm hard drive that is include (far too slow for this setup, acts as a huge bottleneck) but was easy to replaceBloatware (common to all computer at this point)I noticed a little bit of CPU whine.  If this continues or gets worse I might have to adjust my review but at this point it seems fine.
