Can't complain... except about Windows 8. I can complain about that. Free Windows 10 coming soon. Computer is perfect otherwise.
Very happy so far. I am really looking forward to the free windows 10 download at the end of June. For a great travel laptop and/or "throw away laptop" this is perfect. If you are one who surfs the internet, does email, Microsoft office and even photo editing. This is it. It will even run Real Flight without issues. CAN NOT beat it for the price. I am just happy that I can get a laptop that suites me and get it for a respectable price. If you are not editing 5 videos at the same time while running a 3D game and running some other heavy processor using program then you don't need a $1500 iMac Book Air Mini pro or a $4000 Alien ware with retina scanner and DNA processor.
