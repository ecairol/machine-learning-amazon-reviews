Disappointing
Terrible speakers, 54 updates needed just one week after purchase (which took an hour), Bluetooth won't pick up my devices, the two-finger page-down feature stopped working after updating and did I mention the speakers are no good? I can barely hear YouTube videos on max volume yet these are Bang Olufson?
