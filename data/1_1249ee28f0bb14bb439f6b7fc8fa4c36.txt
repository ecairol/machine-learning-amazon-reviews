Great Christmas Gift
This iPad is so beautiful. It's unbelievably light, and thin for a full size tablet. This iPad  also extremely fast and made me finally realize just how slow my iPhone is.  The screen on this thing is also sharp and beautiful. The only bad thing about this product is that the screen attracts a lot of fingerprints, but a screen protector can easily fix that.
