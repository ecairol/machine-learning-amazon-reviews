Been through 2 so far and now # 2 will be going back
On my 2nd one and now,after 2 months, it appears as I will be contacting them for a replacement or return. I have added no software to my laptop and it is beginning to show signs of slowing down.  Some pages wont even load now and the speed of moving the pointer across the screen takes 3 or 4 swipes.
