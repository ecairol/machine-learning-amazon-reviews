You can tell how disappoint I was
I bought this as a gift for my aunt. When I received this, I found the iPad was pre-owned. To make sure about this, I also double checked the unique code on the back of iPad on the apple.com. It showed this iPad was activated on April, 3 months before when I got this. You can tell how disappoint I was.
