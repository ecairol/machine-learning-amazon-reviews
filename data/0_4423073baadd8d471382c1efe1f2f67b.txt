Micro HDMI problem! Do not buy
I notice quite a few people posting comments regarding issues with the micro-HDMI output on this machine. I very rarely post any kind of review but in this case I feel people should be warned!With two different machines, having exchanged the first, I found that the output via HDMI to a second monitor (tested with AOC and JVC) was blurred - noticeably bad image quality especially with text in windows, browsers etc.I don't have the same problem with my small ASUS X205T - it seems there is something poorly designed in the UX305 graphics module / HDMI output. ASUS tech support have not replied to me. If you use your machine with any kind of external display device, don't buy this!
