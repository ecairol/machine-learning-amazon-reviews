Good all round computing, but the display..
Battery life is a major highlight. The C300 ran for 10 hours 42 minutes on my first run. That's much longer than most laptops on the market.However for me the display is lacking as you can feel a tad closed in on the 13-inch especially if working on a desk at home, and if you plan to watch videos of films you should look for something with more screen clarity.I would recommend checking out this HP before you buy due to the better screen quality and spec's - http://amzn.to/1OjaGEY
