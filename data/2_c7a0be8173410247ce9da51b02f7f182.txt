lightweight little Chromebook that fits easily in my messenger bag
A fast, lightweight little Chromebook that fits easily in my messenger bag. Everything I was expecting...except I can't give it 5 stars. Why? It's the screen. In general it's great for web browsing, writing, etc. But while watching full screen streaming video, it's hard not to notice that it doesn't handle shadows and dark colors very well. Don't get me wrong, it's not like the image is bad -- far from it. It's crisp,but no one is likely to call it great. That said, if you plan on watching a lot of streaming video, there are other Chromebooks with better screens available (e.g., Samsung). I knew this wasn't an amazing screen when I bought it, and I don't often watch Netflix or other streaming video on it. I bought it because Asus is reliable, it looks great, it's small and easy to carry around wherever you go, and it works fast (note: I opted for the 4MB of RAM; I can't speak to the effectiveness of the 2MB version). My one and only gripe is with the screen, and since I only watch movies and shows on the Chromebook maybe once a week, it's not a big deal. If you plan on watching a lot of movies or shows on your laptop, you might want to consider another model.
