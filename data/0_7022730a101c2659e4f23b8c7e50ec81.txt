Very difficult to adapt
I used to blissfully use a MacBook Pro, however at the peak of my binge drinking, I had gotten drunk and urinated on it. Thusfar, my MacBook hasn't worked since the incident. So, whilst browsing reddit I viewed some hilarious Q&A;'s about this laptop and confirmed if they were legitimate by finding the laptop on Amazon. Accidentally, I had purchased it. When it arrived, I just opened it and set it up, it was already here so why not, right?The reason why I told you my story about my MacBook, which is true, is because I'd like to compare an apple to an orange, or asus.. maybe, rather, anus. At first I had been hit by a sudden urge to grab my VersaMax and put holes in this thing, this emotion was triggered by the fact that it took about 30 minutes to set up because of the need to have a Microsoft account and slow internet because I live on a farm. Whatever, got it done and it was ready to use.. somewhat. I hadn't used a windows OS since Vista.. which was why I changed over to OS X. Anyway, the damned tile thing they used instead of a start menu shows up, and I about lost it again, this time standing on the back porch ready to chuck this thing at a tree. But, I calmed down, patiently navigated and removed all of the junk that they preload on these new computers, and downloaded Firefox and iTunes. Since then, I noticed that it uses DDR3 RAM, my MacBook did too, and it had 8gb, ie 2x4gb cards.. tore this one apart and it uses a single 4gb card.. waste of 15 minutes.Not impressed with the screen, not impressed with the speaker, the keyboard layout sucks and doesn't have background illumination.The fact that an inoperable MacBook Pro from 2010 still outperforms a brand new, running, sleek looking yet disappointing laptop just brings me to tears. I'll keep this thing just to have an extra device to do something with, it has plenty of space, but I wouldn't recommend this thing to anybody, even at a very low price.
