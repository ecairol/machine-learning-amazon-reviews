Better than spending twice as much for a tablet that runs windows!
I've had this little guy for nearly a year now and it is everything I was looking for. Truthfully, I wanted a tablet that could run office but they were high above my budget. Instead, I bought this small lightweight laptop that could also be a tablet. I love it! Main complaints: the keyboard is not very sensitive so I frequently have to go back and add in letters, and the automatic screen rotation sometimes does not work properly. Battery life is petty good. Surfing the web and writing emails I get about 6 hours. If I am streong videos it goes down a bit, as is expected.I mostly use this as an Internet machine as I have little use for additional programs and storage. All of my photos and music are on my Mac and I didn't bother to transfer. If I want music I stream it anyway.Oh! And I'll never go back to a laptop without a touch screen! I love it and it functions perfectly!
