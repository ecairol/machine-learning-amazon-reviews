great looking product
great looking product, they must have spent $10 on the packaging.however the user guide is 3 page tiny pamphlet. plugged it in ,turned it on and....... o.s. not found or damaged!  i couldn't believe it. after reading up on the internet , looks like its a common issue with chrome books . I returned it and am looking for a new pc
