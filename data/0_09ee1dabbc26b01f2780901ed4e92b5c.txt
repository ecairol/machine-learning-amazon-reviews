I received computer June 15, 2015, I bought this based on a recommendation from friend and the reviews, my mistake.  Initially I was going to give it to my granddaughter for her birthday.  However when she tried it out she didn't really like it.  Since I needed a new computer (replacing an old Dell Desktop) as well,  I told her I would keep it and she could pick out one she liked.  I've been wrestling with this thing ever since, Windows 8 is awful.  I don't need nor want all those apps, I want to be able to access the internet and use Microsoft Office. The computer is also very slow, I was trying to transfer some picture from a scanner to the computer it took a long time to just create a folder for the pictures, and even longer to be able to save them.  I went to the Office app because I was going to transfer some files from the old computer to the new, and found out it's only a trial offer after the trial you pay monthly. I believe when I bought my last Dell Office was included.  Returning things you buy on line is a hassle so I guess I'll keep it and try to get used to it.
