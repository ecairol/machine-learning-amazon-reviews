has pros and cons
This computer was a replacement for a computer my son broke by accident. Honestly there is so much I like about the computer but there are cons. The laptop is lightweight and has amazong battery life. The screen is vibrant. The computer description says it comes with Windows 10. I was unaware it comes with Windows 8.1 installed and you have to upgrade to Windows 10 yourself. It does prompt you to do so and the download is free. They keys are not I'm bedded but 3 d and lifted. They are blocky, if you will. The number keypad is very different from what I am used to and the placement seems odd. The arrow keys mesh with the keyboard and number keypad. The keyboard and number keypad are really one board. They mouse pad is very sleek. The right and left click buttons are I'm bedded into the mouse pad but are still buttons. I really like the sleek design but they Kay's throw me off. I often times hit the wrong key because it all seems so squished together.  The at stem itself is a little slower and more frustrating as this computer doesn't have an i3 processor but a much slower processor. It seems like once it warms up it gets a tidbit faster. If you need it for basic needs it is a great computer, or even a good starter for your teenager but it's not meant for a lot of program work or data collecting etc. It connects to WiFi quickly and easily and can be used for social media and e mail etc.I purchased this product at full price
