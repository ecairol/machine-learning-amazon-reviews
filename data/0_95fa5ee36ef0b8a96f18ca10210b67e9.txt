Not so Zen
Zero stars. I cannot connect to my recently purchased HP printer (need to download an app that wasn't required for any other laptop I connected to) nor my Microsoft account (invalid account - what?), both of which I was easily able to download and connect to on my boyfriend's Lenovo, and two Dell laptops. What good is a Zenbook when I cannot use it for my school work???Nice robust exterior, speedy processor but that is where the romance ends. Worthless in attempting to connect to a school Microsoft account and worthless in connecting to my printer, wouldn't even load the page to download my printer, although my printer shows in the printer list.
