with a couple upgrades, this baby runs like an i5 or an i7.
This computer was a bit slow when I first received it, but after a couple of easy upgrades to 8 Gigs of Ram, and a Solid State Hard Drive, and about 150 Windows updates from MS (which will be running in the background for about the first 3 days, slowing it down a bit more).. Once the Windows updates are done, and youve upgraded this laptop like I did, it runs like a $600-$800 laptop.
