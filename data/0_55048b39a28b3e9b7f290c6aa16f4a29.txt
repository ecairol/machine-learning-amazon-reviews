Don't waste your money. You get what you pay for.
This has been the worst computer ever. Bought it for my daughter to do school work and it comes with so many programs loaded, it can barely even run.  I have removed as much as I can but it still lags and drags even with browsing on the web.  It has been such a disappointment.  I downloaded iTunes and it took up a majority of the memory.  Terrible purchase. Worst part is I talked two family members in to buying it as well.
