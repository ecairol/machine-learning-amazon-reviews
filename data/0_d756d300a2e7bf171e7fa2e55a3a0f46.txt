Two Display Failures
I bought two of these for our family and the display failed on both of them. The first one failed within the first 12 months so it was under warranty and ASUS repaired it for free (I had to pay for shipping). They replaced the whole display and it's still working fine. The second one failed after 15 months and so is no longer under warranty. We've been pretty gentle with them so this seems like this a design flaw.
