Know What a Chromebook is before Buying~
After using it for a month, I finally decided to write a review when I was listening to songs and impressed by the quality of the audio of this Chromebook. I used it for papers, browsing website, and movies. Everything runs smoothly,but playing videos would lag if I open new tab, it isn't a huge problem to me though. The price is very reasonable for this size!! I bought it for $165~ Don't expect laptop with this price with high resolution screen. I am satisfied with the matte screen it has~ The battery life is super long, at least 10 hours of nonstop usage. I usually charge it once and it lasts two days. I knew what a chromebook is before purchasing, I didn't expect much. But it actually has more than I expect: very easy to use, the apps are easy to install, and very fast. I have other laptops that are running window 7 and 8, but I like this Chromebook much better!! However, beware that it does not show some flash and images on some websites that normal laptops can.
