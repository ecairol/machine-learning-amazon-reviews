Best laptop anywhere near this pricepoint
This is the best computer I've ever had. Its all metal body give it an awesome premium feel, and the 8gb of ram and Intel m process make it super fast. 256 gb ssd that is blazing fast. All of this packed into a body that is 12 mm thick, and less than 3 pounds. It also boasts 10 hrs of batter life, and even though I have not gooten a full 10 hours it consistantly delivers 9 hrs without a problem. This laptop has all of the same specs as the new Mac book, while retaining a pricepoint of almost half of its apple counterpart.  Plus, with the free windows 10 upgrade, you get a great opperating system. The only draw back that I have noticed is the tiny speakers, but this is no problem because of the enhanced audio you get from Bang & Olufsen when you plug in a pair of headphones. All in all, this computer combines the portablilty and premium feel of the new Mac book, while retaining the compatibility of a pc.
