So far so good
I am making this review from this laptop. I can't give an in-depth techy review as others and in addition I have only used this for about two days so far. I love the different modes. The stand mode works best for me when I am in class (online) and the lecturer is explaining. The speakers sound louder in this mode because the holes at the bottom face up. The laptop mode works best for me when typing for extended periods like doing a report, assignment, letters, etc. The tablet mode, I use when traveling to and from work. Remember no cd drive, I forgot I agreed to that when I purchased this and went looking for one. So far so good, (owner of 5 days). Speed is good. Would update this post in the future as I figure out the details of this.
