My first, and last Dell
I received the new XPS exactly 3 days ago.  After setting up Windows 8.1, I was really liking the small, lightweight form factor it had.  The touchpad was right on, the backlit keyboard felt good.  The second day I installed a few basic applications, Spotify, Steam, and Skype, and while browsing the web I had my first BSOD (Blue Screen of Death).  I thought it was weird so after it restarted I got online to start researching what was happening when the 2nd one hit, then the 3rd one.  Then I went to Dell's Support website and downloaded their hardware checking software.  Lo and behold while it was running its check the 4th BSOD hit! You would think that it's software would be compatible with the above programs, seeing how popular they are, but I completely refreshed the XPS to go at it again anyway.  After configuring Windows 8.1 again, I was just watching a Youtube video when the 5th BSOD happened.  I had enough so I decided to call Dell's technical support just to find it was about as worthless as my laptop was.  I was transferred 3 different times because apparently XPS has its own "special technicians". They determined it a software issue instead of hardware and instead of telling me anything helpful went off on the extra charges I would have to pay to get software support. They could barely speak English, and weren't very "special" at all.  I am currently studying IT and work tech support so I know it sucks, but they really could do better.0/5 stars for Dell's Tech Support1/5 stars for my XPS (Although I'm sure mine was just a dud so 4/5 if it manages to work, just hope you never have to deal with Dell's Tech Support)5/5 stars for Amazon and their money back and free returns, at least we can rely on somebody!
