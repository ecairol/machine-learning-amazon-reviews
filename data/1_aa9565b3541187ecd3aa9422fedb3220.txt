A lot of power in such a tiny form
Pros:- This is as slim and light as my Macbook Air, which is exactly what I needed!- Zippy, solid-state, cool-running, ultra portable- Outputs to my 4k like a dream- Really convenient, lightweight charging cable- Exactly the ports I need and nothing else- Powerful enough to do justice to many games without stuttering, which is so nice in an ultrabook.Cons:- Zero multitouch/scroll on the mousepad. That means that any time you want to scroll down a page with the touchpad, you need to navigate over to the window's scroll bar, and manually move it up/down. Very annoying. But I got around it with a multitouch-enabled Bluetooth mouse and the right drivers, so it's a problem solved.- The more graphically intense games will need to be toned down. (e.g. Don't Starve has no trouble, but Ark is a mess unless you cut everything down to minimal detail.)
