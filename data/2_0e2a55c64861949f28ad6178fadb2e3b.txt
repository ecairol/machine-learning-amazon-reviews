Exceptional laptop for the price. Very similar to the new MacBook but for half the price. The screen is awesome (wouldn't recommend more than 1080p for such a small display) and the colors are great. The SSD is fast and makes mechanical drive-based laptops feel awful to use. The processor is fine, power efficient, and can render 3D fairly decently compared to the last integrated graphics solution I had (you're not going to be playing games past World of Warcraft). The plumb-purplish color was sort of a setback at first, but I have grown to liking it. The keyboard is ok (what do you expect?) and the touch pad is alright. I'm not sure if it's software or hardware based, but sometimes it can be finicky. The aluminium is a little smudgy, but cleans off well. Overall, it's very competitively priced. I never thought weight and size would be a considerable factor in purchasing a laptop, but once you know, you can't go back. I highly recommend this laptop to anyone who is constantly on the go or on the web (battery life is ~5-6 hours web browsing). Also, I don't recommend buying laptops refurbished unless you have some experience installing drivers and diagnosing weird problems (Amazon has to wipe/reinstall Windows, and while it won't come with typical laptop bloatware, it loses some functionality out of the box that you can fix, of course).
