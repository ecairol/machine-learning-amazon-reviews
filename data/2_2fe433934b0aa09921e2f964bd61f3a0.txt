Used problems as expected bur very nice for the price!
Bought the laptop in very good used condition. It had a few minor scratches and any vibration would leave two spots on the screen which was annoying but overall it was a good purchase. I expected some damage when buying a used laptop, they are only minor problems. This laptop is very nice for the price.
