For a laptop it's fine. It does everything I need it too
For a laptop it's fine. It does everything I need it too. I watch movies/e-mail/games. The speakers are terrible though. unless it is dead silent in my house (good luck with twin toddlers running around) I can't hear much so i bought some external speakers. I am not happy that I can't hook it up to my tv though. After I tried I kept reading conflicting things but everything I tried makes me believe it won't happen
