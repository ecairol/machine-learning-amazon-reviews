like a wise person I restarted
Well, I bought this and it lasted about 8 hours.  I installed the Microsoft updates it said to.  Installed Evernote and Dropbox.  Then I noticed I had notifications in my taskbar that said I had to restart due to "disk errors".  So, like a wise person I restarted.  That was all she wrote.  Will not boot, refresh, system restore, boot in safe mode - nothing.  Totally useless.  Called ASUS and they said its over for it and just send it back.  Wow.
