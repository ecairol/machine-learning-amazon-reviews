Do NOT buy the ASM1 version of this laptop if you plan on running Windows!
Folks, there is a much better and less expensive version of this laptop that is optimized for Windows 8.1 without any of the third-party junkware or bloatware installed, the UX305FA-USM1.  The USM1 is the "Signature Edition" version of this laptop optimized by Microsoft for maximum speed out of the box.  It is currently available direct from the Microsoft Store for only $597.64 after the 10% off educational discount and additional 5% off you get by texting MSHS to 29502.Don't get me wrong, even this ASM1 version is decent (same hardware), but the USM1 version is much better if you want to run Windows with optimized settings without a bunch of fuss trying to get to a truly clean install.-----------------***EDIT TO ADD (03/26/15)***: Looks like the 10% Educational discount has ended on that USM1 model. Sorry for those latecomers who missed it. Must be too popular of a model over there at the Microsoft Store. It is still available for the base MSRP of only $699.99 though, which is still a steal for what hardware you get with this ultrabook, and cheaper than most third-party sellers on Amazon are charging for the ASM1 model right now.
