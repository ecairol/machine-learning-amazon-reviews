Light weight and serves the purpose of a small laptop
We bought this from Best Buy. We've had this for 2 weeks and it hasn't disappointed us. Our daughter is using this for her school purposes.  Once we disabled (and uninstalled) the startup junk programs, lagging was greatly reduced and turn on and off is quicker. It is sturdier, looks sleek and serves the purpose. It is actually 3 pounds or less (not 4.7lbs as in the description). Wi-fi works excellent maybe because of the power settings as the other posts have suggested. Would definitely recommend for students.
