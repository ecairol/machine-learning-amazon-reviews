a terrible laptop.
If you want a good computer then do not choose this one. They say it has win8 but you need a disk drive to install. The laptop doesn't have one and I have yet to find one for this b50-45. Lenovo doesn't have it on their website. D-. secondly , now that I have had it a while I am completely disappointed in the performance. It is by far the slowest computer I have ever owned. I have done everything short of taking it to a tech to get some semblance of speed to no avail. shame on lenovo for selling this. for me they put the NO in lenovo. Fsignedgoing back to my old dell!
