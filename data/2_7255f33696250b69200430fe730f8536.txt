Great Laptop with some small drawbacks
Wonderful laptop if you take into consideration the type of demographic Asus is trying to attract. This laptop is wonderful for school and business, allowing you to efficiently draft documents, edit excel files and create powerpoints. It is not for video editing, gaming, or advanced photo editing. The laptop is consistently smooth, boots in under a minute, loads files quickly and never freezes.Build: Precision machined brushed aluminum makes the laptop absolutely beautiful until to touch it. Fingerprints can be seen everywhere and this problem is known to Asus as they include a micro fiber cloth. The laptop feels sturdy and does not flex easily. The keyboard keys are extremely shallow compared to other ultrabook models however this never causes a problem while typing. Typing is smooth and was an easy transition.Speakers: Worst speakers I have ever heard on any laptop. The quality is obviously extremely high except the sound volume is painfully low. I would recommend listening with a good pair or earphones instead of using the speakers.Touchpad: Touch pad is extremely responsive and smooth however, both the right and left click tab are extremely loud. At first I thought this would not bother me but after a while it started to get on my nerves. This may not bother you and it may just be pet peeve however it is worth mentioning.Besides what I have stated above this is a solid laptop that is perfect for average work and multi-media use. I would highly recommend and do not regret my decision at all. A great and cheaper alternative to the new Macbook.
