Could be the laptop to get me back to Windows unit, but public WiFi problem
I've been using an Acer C720 Chromebook for the last 19 months -- loved its light weight, almost instant boot up, SSD speed (albeit small size), day-long battery life.  Of course it wasn't Windows, but the cloud was allowing me to get much of my work done.  But... it was getting a little under-powered when working with large Google Docs, and of course the occasional *need* for a Windows powered app got me to look seriously at this unit.Of course this ASUS Zenbook is more expensive, but the value for these features was more than I could pass up.  To see Windows boot up in seconds, to see a USB 3.0 portable HDD connect at about 4x the old HDD speeds, to see a WinPC laptop weigh about the same as the Chromebook... well, that is what I was waiting for.  It may be a little larger footprint, but it is pleasantly thinner.  It seems just the right size after using it 7 days.I generally agree with previously reports of lightweight, advantages of the matte FHD screen (right resolution, no glare).  Keyboard was quite sufficient, maybe better than Chromebook.  Trackpad took some time to get used to, but now I can be comfortable with it... wish it was a little smaller, like the Chromebook, so it would be a little less finicky.Battery life is not as good as the Chromebook... even with very light usage, the battery seemed only 2/3 the life of my Chromebook... maybe 7 hours of decent usage.  But I could live with that.  But I loved the fact that the Zenbook could load multiple Chrome tabs, some with large Google Docs, and not have to reload a tab when returning to it.  The Chromebook was getting weak in this regard for my heavy-lifting needs.= = = = = = = Public WiFi - "limited connection" = = = = = =But I have hit a snag that is forcing me to consider returning this unit under the return period.  And I have seen this problem mentioned in a few other reviews.  The second day I had the unit, I went to the local bookstore/coffee shop (you know the one) to logon to their public wifi and could only get a connection with Windows message: "The connection is limited" ... i.e. NO INTERNET!  I have been to Microsoft's phone support and community forum and another tech forum to explore options to get this to function.  Although I have some success at some public wifi sources (major hardware chains, Ronald's hamburgers, etc.), I have exactly ZERO problems with my Chromebook on public wifi... period.So if ASUS wants to respond to this posting, they will have to give me solid tips that will work, because I have tried many ideas to no avail.==>> Has anyone else had this problem?  More importantly, has anyone had the problem and solved it yet?I will update this if further progress is made. = = = = = =  Update June 17, 2015  = = = = = = = = = = = = =Although I continue to have problems at the bookstore public WiFi, I plugged in a TP-Link USB Wireless N adapter, loaded the driver and viola!... it connected to the bookstore wifi almost instantly.  So until Asus and/or Intel get a driver for this AC stock adapter that behaves better, I'll pack this small 3rd party adapter for public connectivity.  I'm upping my rating from 3 to 4 stars now.= = = = = =  Update July 4, 2015  = = = = = = = = = = = =1) Clarification: the Wifi problem discussed above relates only to the newest Intel Dual Band AC 7265 adapter, not the N adapter that is in some units.  As of today, Intel is hoping the next driver update will solve the problems mentioned on their support forum... here's hoping.2) An additional aspect of this unit not mentioned elsewhere AFAIK is that the video output of HDMI 1.4 is at a disadvantage to the DisplayPort output offered on Microsoft's own Surface units.  That is because the DisplayPort output, at least the newer one, offers a higher refresh rate (60 Hz not 30 Hz) and the possibility to daisy chain multiple monitors.  The refresh rate might cause some problems in mouse movement delay and smoothness in web page scrolling, especially if you hook up a UHD (or 4K) display.  The multiple monitors would be handy for desktop replacement purposes.  This was not a deal breaker for me as I will figure out how to deal with HDMI for now.
