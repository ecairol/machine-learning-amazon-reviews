BUY IT!!!!
This Camera is what i expected and whats even better was i got it on sale for $50. I was gonna buy it for the normal price aanyways but the fact that it was on sale when i bought it is even better. I use it for making videos for my public presentations class and also for streaming on TWitch.tv.... It has excellent quality and i like the wide view it gives. If you are not into the wide angle cameras then this may not be for you but im sure there is some way you could adjust it. Im not sure though on that.Pros: Not too much cost wise compared to most cameras.Wide View and Clear ViewLooks nice on top of my monitor.It is also able to be put on a stand.Cons: Nothing really that i have any problems with.BUY IT!!!!I included a picture of my ugly mug just to show you what a picture on this camera looks like. Also this is low lighting and it looks like i have quite a bit of lights on which is nice!(Excuse the messiness)
