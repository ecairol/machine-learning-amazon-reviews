... my middle schooler and it seems to be working great for his needs
I purchased this for my middle schooler and it seems to be working great for his needs. It is used for mainly class work, and since everything saves to google docs the computer isn't likely to slow down. Only downside is he has to have internet access to be able to work on his documents.
