Disappointed
I was disappointed.  It seemed like a great computer and a great deal.  The first one arrived and it did not work.  Now,I have a two one.  The space bar sticks.  I find it hard to navigate from screen to screen.  For a non-computer savvy person, it was very disappointing.  Next time, I am going back to Apple.
