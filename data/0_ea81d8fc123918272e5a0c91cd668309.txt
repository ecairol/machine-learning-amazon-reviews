Its iPad Air
Upgraded from 4th generation iPad that we had for 2 years and immediately noticed that sound really sucked compared to our old one, you can barely hear anything when watching YouTube and other videos. Had to send it back just for this reason, got the 2nd version of iPad Air instead and glad I did, much much better spekers. Can't really tell much of a difference for the screen over last two versions. Wanted to save couple of bucks over the newest one because it's a lot cheaper now but not worth it.. Happy iPadding!!
