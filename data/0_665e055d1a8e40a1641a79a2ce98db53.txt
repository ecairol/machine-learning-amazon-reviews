Customer service is also horrible. They only say "it is unfortunate"
I bought it in June, model xps 13 9343.Starting from trackpad problem, battery cable and now fan is not working. I had to send the laptop back to Dell two times since Oct.Dont buy this. Seriously buy other brands.Mine is manufactured in April 2015 and so far I have two major issues to send back to Dell. Caution don't buy this.I am so unsatisfied. Probably buy other laptop and sell this in Ebay.Customer service is also horrible. They only say "it is unfortunate".Folks. Dell fails me so much.
