One must read the  specs first before buying this laptop. This is my second purchase, one for a friend and a few months later, for myself. I've worked with computers this past 40yrs, and this isn't a i5 or i7 in speed but if you need something inexpensive, to check your email and browse the net, this one fits the bill.I just needed to do simple surfing, no touch screen, no dvd player but otherwise that's all I needed. I can attach a flashdrive or external portable hdd via any usb port. Didn't need all the extras;  I have that on my other i5 laptop.For a first-timer, this one;s for you. Not a big investment and you got a bigger screen than those tablets.
