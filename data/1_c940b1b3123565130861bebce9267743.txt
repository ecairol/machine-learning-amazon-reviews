OK'ish laptop with plenty of development needs
Overall laptop is quite OK.For me laptop stands out for good screen, good design and substantiation battery life (guaranteed more than 6 hours in economy mode which is OK for work, sometimes it reaches 10 hours depending on tasks)Still I have some questions as it is not the cheapest laptop and it should be really good.1) I really don't like sound. My smartphone's sound is much better than this - I don't know what to say  more.2) Touchpad drivers are really bad - when you scroll up or down and press ctrl afterwards it suddenly changes zoom on the page. It is incredibly annoying and I really don't like it.3) Power button is located near button 'del' and 'backspace'. Who designed the keyboard layout? What was in the head of this person? I ended turning of the power button to avoid accidental turning offs of my laptop4) There is no keyboard light. Quite poor for premium laptop.5) After 1 month of use the emerged a slack on one side of the body. You can hear 'clack' sound and feel that laptop body is not tightly tailored.6) And finally, there are frequent WiFi problems but I tend to blame Windows for this.Finally, laptop is OK'ish but not perfect overall.But comparing to my previous Lenovo X1 Carbon (1st generation) it is really perfect so I never return to Lenovo-)
