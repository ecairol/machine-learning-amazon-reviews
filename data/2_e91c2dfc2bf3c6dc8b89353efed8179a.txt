iInoperable touchpad
The touchpad on this laptop is junk!!!  It's very hard to use compare with my Apple laptop.  It also self destructed after a few hour of use.  I now use a cordless mouse, which is much better.  Otherwise a decent laptop for the price.I got the pointer to work again from the touchpad, but the two finger scrolling up and down still is problematic, not like my Apple.  Also, the picture quality is nowhere near the Apple, but the price is 10 times less, and the speed is close.  I think the price is still a bargain.
