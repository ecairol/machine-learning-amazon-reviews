Had to return to the manufacturer after only a month - the battery was faulty and had to be replaced.  The return process was slow and expensive ($39 to return via UPS).Other than that, it's a good fit for the family - the kids use Chromebooks at school and we store most of our household docs, photos, and videos on Google Drive.  The screen resolution is superb.  Keyboard is solid.To be fair, during the battery issue, ASUS customer service worked hard and stayed in touch until the problem was resolved.I would probably buy it again considering the value.
