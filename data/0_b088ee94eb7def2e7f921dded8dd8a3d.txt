Poor quality of trackpad makes this laptop almost unusable
I like the form factor of this laptop. However, the poor quality of the trackpad and the keyboard make this laptop almost unusable for developers. The battery life is also less than half the advertised time. The problem with the touchpad is that it is very unresponsive and the keyboard registers frequently multiple keystrokes making typing a real pain. After calling Dell's customer support they sent me a replacement laptop, but there was no improvement. Clearly, this is not a laptop for professional use. I am very frustrated with this purchase. I should have bought another Apple laptop instead where I have never experienced quality issues of this kind.
