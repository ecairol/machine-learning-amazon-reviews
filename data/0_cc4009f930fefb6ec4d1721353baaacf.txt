Not impressed
I bought this laptop in Oct 2014 and in Feb 2015 it stopped working.  It just turned off for no reason and it was plugged in at the time.  No lights or any response of any kind, it just died.  Not pleased or satisfied at all right now nor am I impressed.  It was very basic, no extra thrills or frills, and nothing big was downloaded on it, it was used for simple internet access.  There's no reason for to have burned out or dying like it did.
