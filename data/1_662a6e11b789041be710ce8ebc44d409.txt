I really like the Asus Zenbook and it out performs my expectations
I really like the Asus Zenbook and it out performs my expectations. It is super light, boots up quickly and has performed well with everything I have thrown at it.I am a web developer and this is my out of office machine. I needed a Windows machine with full keyboard, a few USB connectors a decent battery life and a reasonable price. At $699 Asus UX305 fits the bill very nicely.I was a bit worried about the keyboard as I am used to a full sized keyboard. The keyboard is definitely different but still very good. It is chiclet style but has a good feel and decent travel on the keys. Don't expect this to to be the same as full sized keyboard or even a 15.6" laptop keyboard. Do expect it to perform well and be pleasant to use.Performance wise I read the reviews on the Intel M processor and expected it to be slower than it actually is. It is not as fast as my desktop but it doesn't have the same spec., costs 2/3rd less and my full size gaming desktop is just a wee bit awkward to carry around!Battery wise it runs around 5-6 hrs depending on what you are working on. This is not up to Mac Air standards but still very respectable for a machine at this price.The trackpad, in limited use, seems to be fine but I tend to use a mouse.The machine does have a view limitations which may or not be important to you. Because of the small footprint there is no separate numeric pad nor easy Home/End buttons. When it is being charged the area above the keyboard does get a wee bit as does the underneath of the unit. On battery mode it stays pretty cool. Remember this is a fanless unit so heat has to dissipate somewhere. The flip side of this is that the Asus Zenbook is also super quite which I really appreciate.In summary this is a fabulous machine for the money and I recommend it.
