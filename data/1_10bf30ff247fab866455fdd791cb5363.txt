I love the SSD hard drive
I bought this to replace another ASUS computer I had for many years. I love the SSD hard drive...very quick start up and runs very cool. The screen clarity is awesome. Very happy with the keyboard. I didn't want to spend any more dollars for upgrade to i7 chip. I'm not a gamer and this i5 sizzles through apps. Very happy with this ASUS.
