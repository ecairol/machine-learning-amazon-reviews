Works great and for the price its a steal!
It's a simple laptop that has great speed. I read a ton of reviews here before I chose this one.  I use mine for email Facebook Netflix and some online shopping. It has worked perfectly for that.  I have only two complaints ... first I can't print directly from the laptop I need a wireless printer and have to go through the cloud. Secondly the touch pad for scrolling and clicking is a pain it doesn't react well at all.  However that being said for what I paid for it and how well it works if it gets too irritating I can always go pick up a wireless mouse and that will fix the problem.
