Excellent portable machine
Excellent portable machine. Only had it a few days, but it's done everything I've needed (word processing, media streaming, web browsing). Very aesthetically pleasing and light as well - meets all my expectations.Only issue is that the screen seems to go back and forth between dim and bright - not sure if there's a weird setting going on or an issue with the display function.
