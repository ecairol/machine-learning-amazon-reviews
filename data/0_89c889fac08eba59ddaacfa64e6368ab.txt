Could be great
If I could get an extra ASUS-original power cord, this would be a great laptop.  Unfortunately, ASUS does not offer this part to their customers.  So far, I have wasted hundreds of dollars on cheap knock-off power cords with various issues.  Some of them are simply way too short (like three feet total).  Others have voltage that are dangerously out of specification (get a volt meter before testing these things on your valuable PC).It is unfortunate that ASUS does not support their customers more.  Otherwise they'd take over the world with this PC.  A touch screen would be nice at this price level, especially since my cheapo laptop came with one.  I don't use it but my kids do.
