Perfect for a student!!
Compact, light, and efficient. The only reason I didn't give a five star is that there are many limitations to what you can do compared to a regular laptop. For example, the keyboard. Overall, a wonderful product that is perfect for a student with no interest in online gaming. I would recommend this product to anyone who is into basic use not online gaming and such.
