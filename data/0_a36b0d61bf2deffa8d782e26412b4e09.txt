Pretty soon the computer stopped going to the log in ...
Only lasted me a month before it started having problems...I took care of it, bought a new case for it, etc. A few days ago I couldn't log in because the keyboard wouldn't respond. Pretty soon the computer stopped going to the log in screen altogether and just became a black lit screen. As a college student, this was an annoyance and a huge hindrance.
