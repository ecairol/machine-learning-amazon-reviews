Super fast but somewhat complex in handling
Love the aesthetics of this unit but feel lack of control over particularly the use of the mouse. Three days out of the box and already had to send back to the factory for wireless card problems. Jury still out on this one. However, it is super fast. From clicking POWER button to full desktop probably about 15-20 seconds.
