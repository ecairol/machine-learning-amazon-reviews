Don't waste your money
The Chromebook has to be connected to WIFI at all times. That would be fine, except it won't hold a damn connection and is constantly turning over without loading pages, or dropping the connection entirely. This happens with every WIFI connection, no matter where I am. It is a problem people have reported with Chromebooks of all types for years, and so is most likely an unresolved issue with the Chrome OS. Yet Google continues to release these products with no fix, and no warning.Not everyone experiences this issue. But enough people do that it makes buying one of these a crapshoot. Since the ASUS C300 doesn't have an ethernet port to tap directly into the web, there is no way around it if you do end up with the connection issue. Don't bother with this device, and get something reliable.
