Good For The Price, I Guess
Wish I could have gone with something a little more expensive...  I mainly only have two issues with this laptop.#1 The shift key doesn't work. It started to go out about two months after I bought the laptop, the shift keys would only work half the time, until it just quit completely. I write a lot, so as I'm sure you can imagine this is a really big issue for me. I have to use the on-screen key board for anything that I need shift for, it's a pain in the butt, but it's better then nothing.#2 The touch screen capability has never worked, I know the touch screen isn't much at all, so it's not a big deal, but when I pay for something I expect everything on it to work, even if the item itself is cheap.Overall, it's a good laptop for the price, if the shift keys worked then I would have gave it a five star.
