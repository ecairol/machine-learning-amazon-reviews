Asus X551MAV without optics
satisfied...but not overwhelmed. Laptop is as described...but will get optics next time--I never realized the problems of backing up without optics-flash drives will work but found out the hard way that a 16Gig will not hold the 16 windows files ..since they have only 14.5 available. Battery CANNOT be removed (is inside unit completely)case is 100%plastic.. My ASUS S56C is a much better constructed laptop..a real cadallic compared to this one. But for $212..it is functional. Would be a great starter for youngsters.
