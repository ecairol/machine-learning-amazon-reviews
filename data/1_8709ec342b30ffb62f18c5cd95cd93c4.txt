Excellent lap-tab for browsing/netflix/simple tasks
I bought this with the intention of having a simple small cheap computer I can download things and take on trips to watch netflix if I want. This one works very well for those uses.Quick to start (I did upgrade to WIndows 10), the touch screen is responsive, the volume is good and loud, the screen looks good. Flipping the laptop into a tablet is easy and I don't feel like I'll break it. It folds flat and is as thick as an actual tablet.In terms of hardware/software: - a USB 3.0, and 2.0 - micro HDMI - SD card reader - webcam and microphone - battery lasts about 5+ hours - the processor is 2.16ghz and it works nicely, not a lot of lag at all - not problems with the bluetooth and wifi connectivity
