Good If You Don't Mind a Product that Fails Not Long After Purchase
I write to update the review below, as this Chromebook is failing and I have owned it for only about eight months.  If the crashing were not enough, now the screen fails whenever it is adjusted backward or forward.  No image, just lines and lines and lines and lines.I may try to get Asus to provide a replacement, but as anyone who has ever had an encounter with 'customer service' knows, my chances of getting this addressed are slim.Buyer beware:  If you purchase a product that fails within a year, necessitating replacement, you must double your cost and add in a factor for lost time and transactions in order to arrive at a more accurate price.  Maybe twice the sales works for Asus, but it won't work quite so well for the consumer._________________________________________________This was my first Chromebook, and as with all firsts, one tends to be more enamored of the idea of the thing than its reality.  I have enjoyed this product but after three months am being beset by unfixable failure.  Shockwave Flash crashes without any known repair, precluding access to streaming services.  Chrome does not respond to requests for help.  Suddenly quirks are cropping up like "this site has too many redirect loops," which means nothing, particularly as the site was accessible a day or so ago.  Powerwashes can feel like one is doing something, but there are risks.  These issues do not, squarely, belong to ASUS but they are worth bearing in mind.Other than the above, this is a cute little lightweight laptop for surfing and email.  Not suitable for big written projects, as the hokey-pokey that has to be engaged in to switch between Word and Google Docs is truly wearisome.
