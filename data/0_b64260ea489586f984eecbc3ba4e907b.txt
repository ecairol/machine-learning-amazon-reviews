good luck getting any help from Google
No back lit keys, on several occasion decided on its own, to reset itself. Somewhat limited number of apps available and what's out there, is very basic.  Is missing the F5 Big IP VPN software, so cant be used for business remote logins.The support is abysmal, good luck getting any help from Google; you are redirected to the equivalent of a Wiki/bulletin board combination with questions answered via email by some geek down the street which probably knows less than you do. Also, don't get confused thinking that is running an Android OS, is not, is running a kludged version of Linux.
