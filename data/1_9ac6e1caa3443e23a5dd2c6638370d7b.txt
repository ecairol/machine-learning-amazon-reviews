Couple things...
This was purchased as a gift.  Previously purchased the exact same laptop at a brick and mortar store.  When this arrived, gave it a once over to assure no damage, correct product, etc.  After the receiver of the gift began to set it up and use it we all discovered that it did not include a CD/DVD drive and had a partitioned hard drive.  Was definitely not what we were expecting.  If it were not for that I would give it 5 stars, as it is a great laptop. I love mine and especially love that it came with a CD/DVD drive and a non-partitioned hard drive. For slightly less of a price I might add.I guess maybe I should have paid more attention? But considering how I had previously purchased the exact same laptop at another store, I thought I knew exactly what I was purchasing.  Apparently not.  Obviously, those issues were not the end of the world and can be worked around.  However, I think it should be a lot more black and white that this laptop has those "specs" or lack thereof.
