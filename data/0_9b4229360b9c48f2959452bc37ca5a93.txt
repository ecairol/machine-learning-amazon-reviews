DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP - product arrived with hardware problems and Dell won't send a new machine
DO NOT BUY DELL PRODUCTS.  Do not buy this laptop.  The keyboard came broken (apparently common problem - repeated letters), rendering the laptop largely useless.  They sent me a broken laptop, and will only replace it with a USED laptop.I spent nearly 20 hours (yes, 20, over the course of 30 days) trying to resolve the problem with Dell tech support. First, through 3 different calls they updated the software drivers. That didn't work. Then, they removed Windows and reinstalled (rendering all the setup work I had done completely useless, and adding a few new problems).  That took 5 hours on the phone with them. That still didn't work, so they sent a technician to replace the keyboard.  That also did not work.  Now they are only offering me a refurbished machine, because I have had the computer for more than 30 days.  (I have only had it more than 30 days because they wasted my time trying to fix it over the phone!)After another 1.5 hours on the phone with tech support, customer service, and the refunds department, they say there is nothing they can do.This has been a horrible and time consuming experience.  After wasting so much time over the past month, saying that the problem is that I've had it more than 30 days adds insult to injury.
