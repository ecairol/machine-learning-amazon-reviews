Not Thrilled.....
I struggled with getting this laptop to operate correctly for about two months and spent more money on technician calls than I care to think about. I will say that at the moment after my last visit from Geek Squad it seems to be operating correctly, but it will be my last Dell.  Before purchasing this laptop I had a Thinkpad for many years that never gave me a moments worry. Why oh why did I switch brands.
