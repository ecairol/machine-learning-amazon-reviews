ASUS C201  Worst Chromebook of all..The tegra 1 was slow.Wifi  crappy. Only one I Iiked was the C720, i3. Beautiful with 4gb ram
Have owned 5 Chromebooks so far.. This was a Keeper. Last one was the 13" with Nvidia processor.. proved to be a loser. .slow..bad screen in short a loser all around. Only the Acer C720 with the i3 processor and 4gb ram was great. But not a positive keyboard... nor weight. Now I receive via Amazon's Prime Day sale the best ever. for the price it was worth the cost. .but I can never reccomend it for use online at all unless you have lots of time to waste.. waiting for it to work.Ok for kids I guess.. not for adults . .avoid this item.Supposed to be great on wifi but turns out even with 4gb of ram it sucks.Also the SD card slot busted first day. so floppy and junky.I will keep it since I tried to get the stuck SD card out and got even worse. I'll use it in case of emergency .
