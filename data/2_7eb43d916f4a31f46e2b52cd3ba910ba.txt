Only WIFI
I think Chromebooks are great if you have enough online storage for your stuff.  I got this for my son to take to school everyday because his school requires each student to have one. The only thing I really hate about it is it does not have an ethernet cord plug outlet, it only runs on wifi and sometimes you go places (such as school sites) that have wifi passwords and it would be nice to just be able to plug the computer in, or else you don't have access.  This happens to me all the time, because I travel from school site to school site.
