What th'?
Have needed a light laptop for quite a while for travel and decided to go with this one.It had Windows 8.1 (I'm a 7 user) which I was not accustomed to. I was not able to connect to our home wifi, although I could see it. After a call with Amazon customer support then a 2.5 hr call with ASUS customer support (where we did lots of steps, lots of loading things, etc etc), we discovered I couldn't connect to our home wifi. I had another laptop up at the time and of course it connected perfectly. Very odd. No one has ever had a problem with our wifi. ASUS rep said to send it to them and they'd look at it. But I decided to return it to Amazon Prime instead, got a full refund, and just bought a Dell XPS 13, which I love (so far!). It instantly connected to our wifi. As expected! I don't usually send new defective things for fixing. It suggests QC issue. Who knows what else is wrong??
