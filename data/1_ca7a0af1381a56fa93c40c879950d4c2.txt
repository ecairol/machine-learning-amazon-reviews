Good Laptop for Price.
Runs pretty smoothly with no problems. The included mcafee antivirus software is pretty horrible and slows down the pc, so id recommend getting AVG or something else after the trial period. The laptop itself is not for heavy use of intense programs. Mainly surfing the Internet, watching videos and typing docs.It's built pretty clunky and I sometimes have to press with two fingers on the touchpad just to get it to click. When it should be just touch sensitive. I think it maybe just Windows 8 slowing it down, might downgrade to Windows 7. But overall great laptop for the price.
