Don't let the nitpicky reviews scare you if you're just looking for a decent flat TV
This TV has turned out to be excellent. It worked out of the box which is always a huge plus, and the picture quality was far better than I expected. The only hang up I have is that the remote sensor is incredible sensitive and if you're not pointing it at the screen like a death ray, it might not register that you punched a button. I was worried because of bad reviews concerning a constant humming noise and a bad wifi signal. The humming is there but even on low volume I don't hear it unless my head is back behind the TV; I'd say it's no louder than any other TV, easily. And the wifi issue is either a diff problem or has been fixed because I have bar none the worst router signal on earth and this TV hasn't buffered once; this was probably the biggest surprise for me. All in all, this is probably the best TV you're going to get for the price, size and fact that it's a "smart" tv.
