My only complaints are that the keyboard is not back-lit and the charger adapter is a weird, inconvenient shape. There's also this stupid sticker they put on the top of the screen that leaves residue when you peel it off, but it comes off easy enough.That said, it's a fantastic computer. The battery life is a little inaccurate for me, but it depends entirely on your usage. I do pretty intense work/gaming and get about 7 hours, instead of the advertised 10-12, but that will of course vary depending on your own usage.The build quality is great, and you get the Macbook aesthetic with the Windows functionality. Not to mention, it's under $1000 (I got mine for $700 on Cyber Monday, but even at $900 this is a good deal in my opinion) and you get Macbook level performance. Great for computer science majors, or generally any college student.
