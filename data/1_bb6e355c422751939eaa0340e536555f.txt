Perfect!!!....Almost....
This little Chromebook has really surprised me:Pros:+ BATTERY LIFE!!!  I cannot say enough about this.  I am not sure how, but this outdoes literally every other piece of electronics that I own.  I hardly feel like I need to charge it, but when I do it only takes a few hours.  I think it has something to do with the stripped down OS, but I can definitely say I am amazed by this.+ Screen - the screen is pretty darn good for the price.  It does struggle at odd angles at times, but overall its very crisp and clear+ Portability - this thing is super thin.  I thought I would need to buy an additional laptop case for it, but I actually just slip this baby into my camera case messenger bag and go!Cons:- This kind of applies to any chromebook, but you don't get a windows-type OS so you don't really have access to programs and software that you might be used to.  For emails, web browsing, watching movies, etc this would be a great option, but it would not be a good option for someone that needed to run specific software.  They do have apps for things like excel, but for the most part, they are terrible- Every once in awhile this freezes up.  It never happened at first, but now every 30 uses or so I need to reboot it.  However, it's not really a big deal since it's never a "OH CRAP I FORGOT TO SAVE" moment since...you won't be doing anything that really requires that kind of saving.- Apps/programs - because you are not using the android or apple app store, your apps are quite limited.  Definitely one thing I really wish I knew going into this, but I'm not a heavy app user anyway so this still works for me.Overall, I really like this chromebook and pretty much never turn on my laptop/desktop unless I need to edit photos or want to play a game.
