This is a great product, near-perfect
This is a great product, near-perfect. I managed to buy the limited-edition UX305 that came with a 512GB SSD, Intel Core M 5Y71 and 3,200 x 1,800 matte IPS screen. The display was absolutely stunning though a few applications like Eclipse IDE weren't able to handle such high resolutions and rendered very tiny icons. I'm sure this won't be an issue with the regular UX305.This laptop is solid-state! How often do you get that? The completely noiseless operation makes using this laptop a pleasure.I have no regrets whatsoever in buying this piece of art. I've done my research (over 1 year) thoroughly and you can see the result! I absolutely love this beauty.
