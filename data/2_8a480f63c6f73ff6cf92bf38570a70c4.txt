this is extremely useful for web browsing
I received my Chromebook last night and absolutely loving it for my very specific general usage.Before buying, please note that this SHOULD NOT be your primary system and it does not replace the use or have the capabilities of a Desktop or Laptop for heavy duty tasks (Gaming, video editing, work).However, this is extremely useful for web browsing, facebook, music and google documents.The main reason I bought this is to take notes in class, but found myself using this more than my custom built desktop,For people who are like minded with me, this only acts as a SECONDARY system for light general tasks.Going into the specs, the system itself and processor is highly acceptable for the price. I would have really preferred this to be an IPS display instead of TNP, but again for the price that this chromebook comes in, it's acceptable.I heard that google is planning to integrate their apps (most, but not all) into the chrome store OS, so that is something to look forward to.Battery is good, Doesn't auto detect WIFI but not an issue for me.Will update in a month and see how I feel about this then.
