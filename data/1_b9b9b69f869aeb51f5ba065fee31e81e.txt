Probably shouldn't
This laptop looks the part and has all the right specs.  Unfortunately, there are too many problems for me to recommend.  I wish I had returned it before it was too late.  I have to change the date and time every time I use it.  Sometimes it even has the wrong year.  The display driver constantly fails, there are numerous browser issues.  The battery life is good, and it is quiet, and seems to perform well, but it's really hard to tell because I'm constantly trying to fix something.  A minor issue, but the 10 key numbers are too small, smaller than all other keys, which makes it harder to use.
