Great little Ultra-Book
For $700 this is a great little Ultra-Book. Best of type I've used...though I've not really used any Apple laptops.The display is bright and vivid, and the keyboard is much better than expected...and better than other laptop I've used. Very good feel and keys are positioned nicely. And so far I've managed to avoid hitting the power key (upper right hand corner)...possibly because there a little white led light giving it's position away.The touch pad...on the other hand...is not so great. It's about on par with others I've used...but the buttons are a bit stiff (hard to press) and the pad itself is often too sensitive and thinks I've tapped it...when I haven't. But then I've had those same problems with other laptops. Still, it's good enough to use in a pinch. But for regular use I got a small Bluetooth Mouse for it instead.Yes. The metal covering does smudge. But the color is a dark metallic charcoal color, and so except in the sun the smudges are hard to see...and easy to white off with a little alcohol (on a tissue)...or pre-soaked lens cleaning cloth.But it has a really solid feel and is so light weight and thin. Really love it.
