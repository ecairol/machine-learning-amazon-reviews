Solid product - Awful customer service
I loved the laptop for the first 3 days I had it, until I noticed what looked like a piece of hair stuck in the laptop screen. I contacted customer support, spoke to Dwayne, and was quickly told my only option is to send it back in and they'll analyze it, and send it back in 9-11 business days. As a student, I can't be without my laptop for that long. Also, Dwayne wasn't able to tell me if I would be charged for this service, in fact he kept dodging the question. Very disappointing experience.
