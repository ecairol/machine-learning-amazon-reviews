Update: Wifi works just fine now after router reset.
Update on UX305:Update: Wifi works just fine now after router reset.Wifi worked right out of box while at my work place. Took it home and it never connected again, though wifi was detected. The same U-Verse wireless router at home works perfectly with 2 PCs, 1 tab, 2 smartphones. Using Ethernet-USB adapter connecting to network, did system upgrade to window 8.1, did Intel wifi driver update, still not connected. Called Asus support, was told to  do a System Restore to the point of very beginning when wifi actually did work. Still no connection after it was done. Did factory setting restore got the same result.Believe it was just a bad luck, I went ahead and ordered a second UX305. It arrived at work today, open the box and turn it on, Wifi was not connecting though it was detected again! Called Asus support and was told to do a wifi driver update. Did driver and system upgrade, and wifi still not connecting. By this time I had enough, I'm not wasting any more of my time trying to debug two brand new laptops, which I believe it shouldn't be my job in the first place. Those 2 laptops are on their way back to Amazon. Utterly frustrated!
