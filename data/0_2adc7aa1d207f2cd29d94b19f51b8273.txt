Not again
This was a disaster.  The laptop came and was set up  properly ... however, the battery would not charge, later the computer didn't even recognize it.  It did run on electrical outlet.  We then found out that the registry was corrupted in 2 areas.  Kept dumping the Flash Player even though it was upgraded.  I have had Acer's before and they were ok for the price .... but this one!  No!  It could have been a one time issue, but would think twice to order it again.  The Seller was great ..... I sent it back and the Seller refunded my money right away.  The problems were not at the Seller level, strictly the manufacturer... Acer.
