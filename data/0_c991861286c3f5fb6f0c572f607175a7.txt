Chrome OS not so good, battery good, service bad
Chrome OS lacks of both computer and mobile features. At first I expected it to be able, at least to run android apps. Most of applications are opened with browser, what? What's the point of browser-laptop. For internet surfing and working this isn't good enough. The only reason why I put 2 out of 5, is because it has a really good battery.I would not recommend buying Chromebook from amazon, because it arrived for me and was in use before (I HAVE ORDERED NEW ONE), it wasn't really that visible, but when I started going to websites it was instantly logging to some1's different accounts.
