A nice affordable Chromebook
This is my first experience with Chrome OS. The laptop exterior gives a sense of luxury for its price. It boots very quickly and the battery life is amazing (almost 10 hours with continuous use of writing and video watching). The screen size 13.3 inch is ideal for viewing and portability, however I would prefer it to be a bit brighter. I have just noticed that the price has dropped further making it a real value for money deal provided you can work "on the cloud" or using the excellent chrome remote desktop application. In a nutshell, this chromebook is definitely worth the money it asks for and it is an excellent introduction to the Chrome OS interface.
