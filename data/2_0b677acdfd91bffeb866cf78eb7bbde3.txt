It is one of the best laptops out there
We have had the ASUS Zenbook UX305LA 13.3-Inch Laptop for a few weeks now.  No major complaints with it.  It is one of the best laptops out there.  It does occassionally not respond as quickly as it should and seems to hang a bit.  It also came with far too much bloatware.  I have one complaint about the keyboard itself.  The delete button is right next to the power button and generally that power button would be a delete button on other laptops so hitting that instantly turns the machine off.  So I feel that is bad placement given need to use delete button fairly often.  What they should have done was to require holding the power button down for a short period of time before it does something.  At least that would prevent accidentally turning off the machine.  Other than those small issues, loving this machine so far.
