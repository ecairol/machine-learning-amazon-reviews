my new best friend....
It was everything I expected....this type of laptop is new to me since it rums on chrome and you have to be connected to the internet which I view as extra security it is awesome with battery life also sending documents you have type is so much easier than an ordinary windows computer very lightweight and not bulky.....the excitement is still fresh so the words to describe not coming but its the best bday gift ever
