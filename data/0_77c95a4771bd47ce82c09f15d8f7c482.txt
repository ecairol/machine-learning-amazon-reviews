This looked like it might be a god one
I was in need of a new laptop, since mine has been getting slower an slower. This looked like it might be a god one, but when I set it up it ran slower than the one I was replacing, then I discovered there was no disc drive. Overall, there were so many things wrong with this POS that I immediately contacted Amazon about returning it and getting a refund. Over a week now since I sent this POS laptop back and still no record at AMZ about my refund coming...
