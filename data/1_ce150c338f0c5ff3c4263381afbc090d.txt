The intel pentium processor is pretty slow and if you are a huge multi tasker
You get what you pay for. The intel pentium processor is pretty slow and if you are a huge multi tasker, this computer is not for you. Make sure you don't open up more than 5 windows or applications at a time or your computer will be extremely slow. Other than that, the computer is "okay". Cool that its touch screen and its definitely a good small laptop that can be used for school. NO GAMING
