Nice try but no real improvement here...
Now for the ASUS.  This is my personal opinion only here.  It works as advertised but I don't like it.  I played with the Toshiba model similar to this one and actually preferred it more.  All the screens on these Chromebooks are horrible.  They are 720 resolution, blurry, very sensitive to view clearly, and the brightness adjustment just can't get it right. If you use this in a very dark room, it's a better experience.  I feel like their should be a sharpness adjustment somewhere.  I give up on these Chromebooks until they improve their screens.In particular, the black plastic case is OK.  A brushed metal version would be significantly better.  The operating system is solid but I did notice the TOSHIBA booting up a little faster than this ASUS.  Battery life is excellent.For now, the screen resolution makes all Chromebooks a no-go. I don't have any problem with the idea of a Chromebook, just the lousy screen. My recommendation is for you to save up your money and get a used Mac Air if you can. You won't be disappointed.NOTE:  Take a look at the new Chromebook from Toshiba with the 1080 high definition screen! Get this one if your looking to get a Chromebook!  I reviewed it here on Amazon.  Hands down the best up to date (Nov 2014)
