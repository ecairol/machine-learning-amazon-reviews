What I don't like, no delete key
Very fast start-up and shut-down speed! What I don't like, no delete key. Have to hit alt+backspace to delete. Excellent battery life, over eight hours on a full charge. Also, cam works fine, but in video chats, my voice is broken up and unintelligible to the persons at the other end.
