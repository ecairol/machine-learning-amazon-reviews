Machine Great for the Price but GOGO Says No Free Passes
I just bought this and GOGO states this unit does not come with 12 GOGO passes. I did see a few other people mention this as well. I had flights this weekend and the GOGO did not work. The first rep gave me a pass and said they would fix the issue. Rep #2 said he checked and this unit is not eligible and he wished me luck. He said he verified this and gave me a 60 min pass for my troubles. For a super cheap machine the keyboard is pretty good. The battery life is insane. 12 hours? Maybe more. I have never seen anything like it. The resolution isnt great but this machine definitely has a purpose. Long flights without power etc.
