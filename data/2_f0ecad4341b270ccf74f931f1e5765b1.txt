very good with serious wifi issues
has good quality, a handsom, quick machine. I had many problems with wi fi connectivity, still not completely solved.. another issue is with the display adapter, it crashed few times and the screen is sometimes stretched until I refresh it. otherwise a perfect machine for my needs
