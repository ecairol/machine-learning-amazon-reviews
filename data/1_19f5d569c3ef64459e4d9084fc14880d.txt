Pretty good, but isn't very satisfying.
This is a great laptop. Games don't lag and it's very fast. There are a few things I don't like about it.  I don't like the camera. The camera is very low quality and it lags. Also, when I plug in my headphones, sometimes the program doesn't pop up to ask me what device I plugged in, which results in the sound not being played thought the earbuds. That annoys me a lot but other than that it's a great laptop.
