Great budget ultrabook!!
Fast as sleek. Great as a work computer for people who need to bring their laptop everywhere. SSD provides amazingly fast speeds as expected.Only problem is that the UX305LA, unlike the Core M model, only provides a cleaning cloth as a bonus accessory. I would've appreciated it if ASUS threw in the usb to ethernet adapter like they do for the Core M model.
