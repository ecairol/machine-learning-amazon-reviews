No 1-Year Accidental Damage Protection
A nice laptop for the price. But beware, the following statement is not true for this product: "1-Year Accidental Damage Protection (only when unit purchased via Amazon). Covers accidental drops, spills, power surges and fire damage for the first year. Visit adp.asus.com."I followed the directions on adp.asus.com, and ASUS says this product does not qualify for this offer.
