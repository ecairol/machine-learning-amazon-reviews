horrible connecting to wireless internet
Does anyone else have serious issues with this computer connecting to wireless routers? I want to like this computer but it won't connect with half of the wireless networks I come across. I'm very close to sending it back after wasting hours of my life trying to fix it with no answers found on any of the support forums
