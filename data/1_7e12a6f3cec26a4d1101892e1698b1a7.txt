I really like the laptop
I really like the laptop, BUT as soon as I turned it on, every bug and virus entered.  I had to get virus removal to clear it up.  Do you have any suggestions so this won't happen to another byer?  This is the reason for the 4 stars.  I have a Asus tablet and I love it.FURTHER INFO IN REFERENCE TO THE LAPTOP.  THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE PRE INSTALLED MACAFEE SECURITY. FINALLY GOT MACAFEE OFF. EVERYTHING IS FINE NOW.
