Very happy with the purchase
It is a beautiful unit, with solid construction, gorgeous display, and of course very light and thin compared with older models. It is running very smoothly  when running games. The battery life is really impressive considering its size. After 5 hours of non stopping video streaming, the battery dropped from 100% to 60%! I am very happy with my purchase and have nothing to complain!
