Now the computer boots up much faster and responds more like it should
I needed a new laptop just to run PowerPoint programs, so purchased this ASUS because of the price, the VGA connection and the speed.  I don't need the screen full of aps I'll never use, so deleted most of them.  But then the McAfee anti-virus program that came installed began popping up virus warning after virus warning and would not remove them.  It was a mess and certainly not what I wanted popping up over my presentations.  So I uninstalled McAfee and installed Norton 360, which seems to have solved my virus, adware, malware attacks. Now the computer boots up much faster and responds more like it should.  The way it operates now, I would probably give it 4 or 4.5 stars.  I don't like the combination touchpad/left and right mouse controls.  Would rather have them separate and the touch pad is not very sensitive without some muscle.  Using a mouse makes things much happier.  All in all, though, it seems to be a good product for my needs.  Sure wish it had Windows 7, though...
