Computer Dead on Arrival
I bought this laptop for my father as a gift. He didn't need anything special, just something to browse the internet every now and then. But this laptop was dead on arrival. The screen wouldn't ever turn on. I should have read the reviews before purchasing this laptop. It seems that a lot of people have experienced this same problem. I went to best buy and purchased a much better laptop for $50.00 more. I gave 2 stars because the return process was fast and simple.
