Bad crashing problems, NOT ENOUGH MEMORY Major Fiasco
I bought the ipad air when it first came out. I am a multitasker, and I open multiple tabs in my browser. The browser crashed every 5-10 minutes, losing log in status and work.The apps crashed constantly. The ipad air rebooted to the springboard constantly.I went to the Apple store and recreated the crashes and reboots on every ipad air in the store. This was after the Apple employees denied ever seeing a problem on the ipad air.It turns out that the ipad air has the same amount of memory as a 3 year old android phone- 1GB.All the quality tablets that came out in the last quarter have 2-3 GB RAM, except the ipad air.Somehow, it is being covered up. By Apple. If you go in their forums, there are plenty of (new users) people reporting crashing problems. Then you have the level 6 and up users denying there is a problem. Many posts are being censored and deleted by Apple.The 64 bit processor needs more memory than a 32 bit CPU - so in effect, the ipad air has LESS memory than the ipad 4.Do yourself a favor and dont buy the ipad air. It is already obsolete. If you must have an ipad, buy the 4th generation one, or wait until the next one comes out. You have been warned.
