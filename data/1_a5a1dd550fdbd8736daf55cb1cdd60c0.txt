This is a good unit for the price
This is a good unit for the price.  I "upgraded" from a sony Vaio that was going on 7 years old.  I don't expect this one to last that long but time will tell.  The construction certainly does not feel as substantial as my vaio but then again I paid much more for it!  It is a good small business computer which is what I use it for.  My only knock on this so far is the keyboard and the mouse.  I type 70 to 90 words per minuet and the key board misses quite a few of my inputs so I'm constantly going back to input missing letters etc.  The mouse pad works okay but it just does not have the positive "click" and feedback I'm used to from my Sony.  Other than that the unit is a good buy for the money, really can't beat it.  Time will tell how long it lasts but overall I'm happy with it.
