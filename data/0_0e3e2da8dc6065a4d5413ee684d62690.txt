Why Chromebook?
This Chromebook is just fine if that is what you like. The low score is for Chromebooks in general. If you are buying this thing thinking you are getting a small Android computer think again! It is not like a computer or an Android device in any way, shape or form. The Chormebook is ONLY good for browsing the internet and using cloud based services. You CANNOT download ANY programs or apps except what you can get from the Google Web Store. If these limitations don't matter to you, buy this, it is great. If they do matter go somewhere else.
