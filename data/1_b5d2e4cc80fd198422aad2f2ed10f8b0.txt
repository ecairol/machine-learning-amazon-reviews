Asus support tested
There is little technical comment I can add to the reviews already published for the Asus Chromebook 13, but my personal experience in getting one repaired may be of interest.This is my second Chromebook; my first being an early model Samsung. I prefer the 13" screen format as I use large spreadsheets. However, two months after purchase last August the screen started flashing on and off. When first turned on it worked fine; then, with increasing frequency to the point of being unusable, the screen would begin to flash. I think, based on the power diode indicator, that the entire computer was going on and off. Nothing seemed to help, whether I plugged it into power or used the battery alone.The problem was not consistent. I say "was", because to my astonishment, it became more or less reliable last November, to the point I felt it possible to take it on an extended trip to remote regions. There, by the law governing electronic things, it immediately, and completely, failed. No blinks, winks or warning; it just wouldn't turn on. Of course, the older Samsung was 7000 miles away.This is my first experience with Asus failing me--I've used their motherboards and other components, including desktops, for years. I have just returned and will begin the process of getting support for a repair, and will advise how it goes by appending this review. I have always felt that half of any manufacturer's reputation should be in how they support the occasional failure.-- 19 January 2015 1100 hrs - We're off and running. After an initial frustration with registration on their website (do they ever complete their own forms?), they have accepted my request for technical support and have promised a response in 48 hrs.
