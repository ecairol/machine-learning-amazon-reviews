Prior To Purchasing This Model, Consider Your Other Options
The ASUS X551M was one of the most disappointing purchases that I have made in buying an ASUS laptop.  The physical quality of the laptop is designed utilizing extremely flimsy plastic that feels very cheap to the touch.  Simply applying a bit of pressure to various sections of the computer's surface reveals that the outer design bends, as opposed to remaining fairly sturdy, suggesting that the internal hardware may be susceptible to damage if dropped because of the lack of firmness of the shell.  Because of this unfortunate flaw, the external design seems to serve as a "word" of caution as to the long term performance and durability of the X551M's internal components (only time will tell).When I made this purchase, it was more out of consideration for my wife's sanity regarding our finances, yet as the saying goes, "You get what you pay for."  The $249.00 price tag is appealing if you absolutely and/or desperately need a laptop because it is a necessity for your schooling or small business needs but do not expect to get more in quality than the amount you pay for at check out.  Basically, if you are looking into purchasing an ASUS laptop, invest your money into a slightly more expensive model and you will find that the overall quality was worth every penny.
