Pretty average cheap laptop.
I haven't really had this computer long but so far it seems to work very well.I bought this computer mainly for web browsing and web development.  The keyboard is one of the best features with normal arrow keys and a number pad instead of the under size keys some laptops have. I can type comfortably on it for hours.The touchpad works well and is fairly large. So large sometimes the touch gestures don't work because my left hand is resting on the pad without me realizing it. Other than that the gestures work perfect almost every time.The USB 3 port is very fast. I copied about 40 gigs of music from my external in the time it took to make a cup of coffee. So that is functional. But it also has a USB 2 port. The ports are color coded.The screen is normal with good color with no dead pixels or flickering so far.The speakers work pretty well during normal usuage but they don't have too much bass (they do have some). Also, they can cut out or lag if the CPU is under heavy load (90%+) such as if your virus scanner is active.Also the speakers do not seem to do well with the Flash Plugin for Firefox for that very reason. It tends to hog the CPU. This is a know problem with Flash.However the Flash built into Chrome seems to run smoother. So, even though I'm a FF guy this computer seems much happier with Chrome instead.The CPU is obviously underpowered and so is the 3D. You don't want this computer if you plan on playing lots of games. But it wasn't designed for that. Also for whatever reason the 3D will sometimes lag if Windows update/matience is running. But for normal computer usuage it works fine.The battery lasts beteewn 4-5 hours. Sometimes less. Maybe more if you're just browsing and not watching videos.The only bad thing is the battery is not easily replaceable apparently. It has no release lever and is built in. Apparently there is still a way to get to it though.
