NOT FOR ADULTS
I bought 3 of these because they are definitely affordable. My teenage daughters love theirs. Having used a Mac previously, I am not a fan at all. It drives me insane. Every time I even lightly touch the scroll pad, the screen changes. It's loaded with tons of apps and advertisements that are just sensory overload and so unnecessary. It took hours and hours just to remove all the stuff I didn't want so that it would be simple enough to use. It is very lightweight, partly because it comes without an optical drive. It also comes with Windows 8, which will not play a DVD, so an external optical drive is useless unless you also download software that will play the DVD/CD.  I think it's a great investment for adolescent children who need a laptop for school work. I think adults should look elsewhere.
