Sleek and Snappy Machine.
I have been using my new Zenbook 305 for about a week now and I really love it.  It took me some time to choose a laptop because there are so many out there!  I looked at Chromebooks, Macbooks and touch screen 2-in-1 laptops.  I finally decided on this Zenbook because it seems powerful enough and have enough storage and memory to suit my purposes without paying for just more machine that I really needed.I am a pretty typical computer user:  I shop, use social media and email on my computer.  I'm not a gamer I don't use graphic intensive programs.  What I was looking for in a laptop was something that would be comfortable to use - light, quiet, and stay cool.  I wanted a no glare screen and had no use for a touch screen device. I wanted something that had a battery that lasted a decent amount of time but I didn't need an ultra expensive machine that was reported to last an obscene amount of time.  Access to plug in is not a problem for me.The Zenbook 305 fit every one of my needs.  It's large enough that I don't feel like I am squinting to see (like some of the 11 inch models)  and it's not so huge that I feel I'm carrying around a t.v.  The Zenbook is super light and thin, it doesn't make a sound...at all...and it stays comfortably cool while in use.  The boot up is really fast and it recharges quickly as well.Overall I think this is a great device and WELL worth the money.
