I am very disappointed with the product
I am very disappointed with the product. I have a strong wi fi signal in the house but the unit performs very poorly on wi-fi. I had to purchase another access point to get it to work. Even with the access point the unit stops working after a while ( not having a fan, I suppose it gets hot) The remote functions poorly ,especially the touch pad. When it is working, it will do what the manufacturer says it will do. I had to purchase a wireless key board from amazon which works perfectly. I have two Sony Internet players with Google TV that work very well. One linked to an access point. the other linkeddirectly to my downstairs router. Too bad Sony discontinued making this unit. I don't recommend anyone purchase this product unless they are prepared to spend an additional $100 . I wanted this unit for my bedroom so that I can stream some programs that require a flash player which my smart tv does not have. If I had it to do over, I would have looked around for another Sony unit. I guess this what to expect sometimes when you try to save a buck..
