Great tablet (Fanboy/tech jargon-free, short review)
I gave this as a gift to my wife this Christmas and she absolutely loves it. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note Tab 2 and right away I noticed the weight of the iPad Air. It felt like a feather compared to my tablet. The display is crisp and VERY sharp, I was amazed by that. The only thing she had an issue with compared to my tablet, was that the speakers on the iPad are placed at the bottom and not on the front facing you, like it is on the Galaxy Tab. We turned it up all the way and it definitely gets loud, so it's not like the speakers aren't good. It's a minor gripe for an overall great tablet experience. I would buy with full confidence if you are in the market for a new tablet.
