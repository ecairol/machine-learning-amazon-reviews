I really wanted to love this ultrabook,
But ultimately ended up returning it and buying a macbook air.  Very satisfied with the air and would not recommend this ultrabook to anyone, as it gave me so many issues with wifi connectivity and constant windows update errors.  I ended up returning it after 3 weeks of owning it.  I think this product has potential, if it could fix some of it's larger issues.
