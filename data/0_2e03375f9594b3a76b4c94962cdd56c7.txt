$198.00 for One Month's use
I loved this laptop when I first got it. The price was great, it was fast and I no longer had to carry my big bulky and heavy Dell laptop around with me to class. However, for having it for only one month the keyboard stopped working. There was no spillage on the keyboard or on the laptop. I also did not drop this laptop at all. I just opened it up one day and half the keys on the keyboard were unresponsive. I tried many times resetting it and even did a factory restore to try and get the keys to work in case it was a software issue but it still did not work. Therefore, I would not recommend purchasing this laptop.
