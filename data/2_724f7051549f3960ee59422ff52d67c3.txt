Like it a lot but consider the Asus Flip 10.1 if the screen and construction/look are worth the extra cash to you.
I just got picked up the 4 gb version in black on Cyber Monday for $179.  And at that price there really isn't much to complain about.The machine is very light for a 13 inch computer, the battery life is great, and with 4 gb it is speedy enough for all of tasks I plan to put it through.  The Google Drive storage is great for backing up all of my videos of the kids, and with a 64 GB SDXC card installed ($19) I can keep a good deal of content saved on the machine too.This is my first experience with Chrome OS and I have previously been running Mac OS and WIndows 10 at home and at work.  Chrome OS is fairly intuitive and you can quickly learn what you need to know with a few quick online Youtube tutorials.  The Google App store works well and with the 64 GB card installed there is plenty of space to save apps and games.  I am an Amazon Prime member and this computer plays nicely with Amazon apps, including the unlimited Amazon photo storage.The only cons are as follows:  Finger prints out the whazzoo, the screen is really dull and lifeless, and the plastic doesn't feel too sturdy.  But again this was $179, so I wasn't expecting much more.If I had to buy it again I would, but I would also seriously consider the Asus Chromebook Flip 10.1.  The build quality seems much better, the battery life seems comparable, and the screen is several notches above.  If they were the same price (4 gb version of each) it would be a no brainer and I'd go with the Flip.  For an extra $30 I'd still go with the Flip.  When I bought the C300 the price difference was $60 and that is 1/3rd of the costs, so for my $$$ and use this was the right call.
