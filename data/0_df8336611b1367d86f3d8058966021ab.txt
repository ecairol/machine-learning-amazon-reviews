disappointment
Truly a disappointment because every time I order a new iPad air there seems to be something wrong with it the first one the battery was dying way too quickly, the second one was dented, for a product that is charging so much money it should at least be stronger all the apps and features on the iPad are of no use if your iPad air is broken or if anything is wrong with it.
