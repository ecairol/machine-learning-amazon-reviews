then it's a good laptop, light
If your only going to use this laptop *strictly* for school or work, then it's a good laptop, light, fast and seemingly well put together. BUT if you want to use it for anything else, i.e.. youtube, video streaming, or any multimedia app, then I would suggest you move on... The audio subsystem in this laptop is VERY under par. Volume is quite low even when at maximum, and when turned up it is distorted. The touchpad is so sensitive that I had to turn it off when typing. Even a slight touch from my thumb, either closed the window I was working on or the cursor jumped all over the place. I sent it back.
