beautiful screen, perfect size
I agree with many other reviewers...Sleek look, fast operating system, beautiful screen, perfect size, and responds well to multiple internet tabs/programs/documents being up at the same time (which was the most important to me as a full time career professional and part time student). Video has been good; speaker output is just okay. It has enough USB ports and an SD card reader as well. And, it's wonderfully thin and lightweight, which makes it perfect for a person who is on the go all the time!Annoyances:The power button is where the delete button typically is and is designed in the same style as any other keyboard button. This really got on my nerves at first, as I kept powering off in the middle of documents (and occasionally still do).  I had a little Asus netbook previously where they managed to separate the power button, so there's definitely room to do that here.The touch pad brings me back to the home windows screen occasionally when I am working, and I still don't understand what move would prompt that response.The lack of back lit keys is not something you think will ever be an issue until you have to type in a dimly lit place!  Still, it's not a deal breaker for me as I am usually working in an area with sufficient light.Nonetheless, for this type of operating system at this price point, I would purchase the exact same computer again!
