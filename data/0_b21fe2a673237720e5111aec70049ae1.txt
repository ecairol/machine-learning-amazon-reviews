In Search of Incredible -  Keep searching
"In Search of Incredible" is the slogan that was printing on the box. I tried boothing this up, entered my WIFI username and password then got a screen saying something like "Detecting Device Configuration" and waited....and waited. An hour later when apparently it still hadn't detected my device configuration I shut it down and am returning it.
