Amazing computer but started crashing almost immediately and loads webpages slower than my old 2GB Samsung
Great form factor, great keyboard, light, with a battery that goes on forever...it is the perfect computer I have been waiting for. But it crashed (garbled purple screen) on the second day I had it and after less than a week now freezes fairly regularly. I think I am going to try to exchange it for a new one in the hope that mine is defective, because otherwise I love this little thing, but I wonder if it's a common enough issue that Asus needs to address.
