It seems to be a good computer
I guess it is a good computer, the battery is not easy access, almost like a throw away computer. Windows 8 has its issues, I am angry with HP for Suggesting Microsoft to turn Windows Defender to off, as for default. It is nearly impossible to turn it back on,  at least I did not find a way to turn it on. Other than that, the computer seems ok.
