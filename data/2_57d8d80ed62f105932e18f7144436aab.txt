Affordable and smooth running laptop
This HP Chromebook 14" is the most cost efficient laptop on the market.  Although it only has 4 gigabytes of RAM, it still is able to smoothly run almost every internet site.  This, and its 1920 x 1080 HD display, make it an extraordinary Chromebook.  Also, the $250 price tag makes it easily affordable for anyone who might want it.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a web browsing computer.
