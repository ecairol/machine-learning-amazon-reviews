Noiseless Laptop with several drawbacks
Though completely quiet, which is why I bought it for recording, light laptop does not have an Ethernet connection.  Instead they supply a dongle that turns one of the USB ports into an Ethernet port.  This would be OK if they had more USB ports to begin with but there are only three.  Take away one - you now have two.  Choose a program that requires a USB elicense, you now have one.  Connect to an external audio recording device like Antelope Zen Studio and you've just used all your USB ports.  Don't even think about a USB mouse!  The  screen resolution is fine but some programmed controls can end up with their OK box outside the scope of the screen which is inconvenient, at the least.  The 256 GB SSD drive ought to have a 512 GB and 1TB option even though that would increase the price.
