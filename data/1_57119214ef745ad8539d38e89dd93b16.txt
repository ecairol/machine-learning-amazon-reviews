Asus Laptop Review
Just got this laptop in the beginning of November, it came brand new and when I opened it up, I got it all set up and it just wouldn't start. The charging light was on but the laptop screen was still black and wasn't lighting up. Although, luckily after a lot of different YouTube tutorials I fixed it and it's up and running. Sometimes it's a little slow, but that could just be my wifi at home and the fact that there are like always five other people at my house using the wifi at the same time. Also, I'm very disappointed it doesn't have a disk jockey.
