Solid Machine
Hardware is great. A beautiful screen, a keyboard that feels good to the touch and doesn't have any randomly place errant buttons (I'm looking at you, all chromebooks). It's light, it's portable, it's sleek.I wasted an hour trying to get two finger gestures to work out of the box. Not intuitive that it's an ASUS program and bios update required and, and, and. I ended up getting angry enough to dump Windows entirely and replace it with Ubuntu.We're purring along now, and the hardware is doing great. I imagine with enough personalization, the software will match the experience.
