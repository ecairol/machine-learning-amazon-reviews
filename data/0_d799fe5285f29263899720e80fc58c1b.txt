Don't buy this junk...
Very cheaply made laptop. Have to send in three times for repairs; third time I downloaded Win10 and crashed the hard drive...after a month in repair and they couldn't fix, they shipped replacement to wrong address and two months later, I'm still fighting with customer service to get another one...and customer service is the worst...don't waste your money on this crap
