UPDATE: Trackpad may drive you insane, Display Driver keeps crashing
UPDATE:Only 2 weeks in, with a cumulative total of less than 5 hours of use (all light web surfing), on FOUR occasions I've had the screen go completely black for a few seconds, only to come back on with an error saying "Display driver stopped responding and has recovered".It's infuriating and unacceptable. I knew when I bought this that it wasn't the Lamborghini of laptops, but even Honda Civics shouldn't have engine problems 2 weeks after you buy it brand new.I've tried downloading the latest driver updates. Needless to say I'll be returning if I can't find a solution in the next day or so.Initial Review (after 1 week of use)Pros: Boots up quickly, all around fast performance, keys have good feel and travel distance, super light and portable, good battery life.Could be better: Brighter backlight on the screen, no backlit keyboardTerrible: Trackpad. I am a Macbook convert, I knew the trackpad was not going to be as nice as that, but this is extremely poor.I use a Dell laptop at work and it is significantly better than this one. The Asus does a mediocre job of tracking movement, but the biggest issue is the material of the actual pad. Imagine a piece of plastic covered in the sticky residue leftover from trying to remove a price sticker from something, and there you go.I keep thinking I'll "get use to it", but it is actually becoming increasingly annoying. You truly don't notice how much you use the trackpad until you have to use a terrible track pad. If you plan on using a traditional mouse you're in the clear, but having to bring a mouse with you everywhere takes away from one of this laptop's biggest strengths - it's portability.If anyone from Asus ever sees this, please address this issue. I (and most people) would be glad to pay an extra $50 on the MSRP in exchange for not having our fingers tortured every time we want to check our email.
