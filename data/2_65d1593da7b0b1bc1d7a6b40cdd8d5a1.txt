Great keyboard, and Linux compatibility, Distracting background light bleed
I've only had this ultrabook for a day now so it's an early review. So far I must say I'm quite impressed. It's very sleek, lightweight and has enough ram and processing power for most everyday tasks. For the price it can't be beat.The first thing I did was switch over to Linux. As a developer my use involves a lot of typing, excellent keyboard feel and quality are a must. So far it has not disappointed. I'm having difficulty not touching the large touchpad while typing. Made somewhat easier once I disabled it while typing.The battery life seems decent, I haven't really tested it yet. I unplugged it at 100% and it was estimating around 7.5 hours. This was with heavy use at the moment and about 30% brightness.I ran some rspec tests from a current project and it ran them at an admirable speed. As far as Linux compatibility it's a 9/10. I did have some issues not being able to change the brightness. I was able to fix this by creating a conf file for the Intel drivers and editing my grub file.Also a word of advice to users of Linux MInt. There seems to be an issue with the kernel currently in use by Mint in regards to suspend on this machine. After resuming the system becomes extremely slow, and and frame rates drop. Upgrading to kernel 3.13.0-51 solves this.Overall a good buy, however there seems to be some background light bleed and it's rather noticeable in 1 spot. Luckily it's not very noticeable apart from booting up or when watching a very dark video.
