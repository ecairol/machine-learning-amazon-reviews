extra unnecessary programs, etc
First off, this comes with Windows 8.1 with Bing search engine. When I got my computer set up and immediately had to deal with viruses, malware, extra unnecessary programs, etc. I tried to open in safe mode and got a black screen and everything kept crashing. I called the company and ended up having to reformat. After that, my volume buttons wouldn't work, so I had to download the drivers from the ASUS website. Now, i'm hoping that's the last issue I deal with. Besides the internal stuff, the laptop is very lightweight and thin. The track pad works pretty okay, but the left and right mouse buttons are a pain to toggle with. Not sure why this computer got #1, other than it's low price though.
