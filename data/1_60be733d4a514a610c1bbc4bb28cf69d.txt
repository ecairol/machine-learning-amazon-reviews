Not as solidly constructed as the older models but good enough for my use
Used Toshiba Satellite model for years. After seven years my old laptop was "dying" so I ordered this. Not as solidly constructed as the older models but good enough for my use. Very pleased with packaging and no problems at all firing this device up and getting to work immediately. Big screen ...CD drive ...plenty of ports. Hesitant at first buying a computer on-line but my fears have been allayed.
