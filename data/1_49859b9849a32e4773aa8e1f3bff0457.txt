below average laptop
Bought this laptop when it was $275.  It's now $199, which is probably the right price for this thing.  The laptop is not terrible, though the track pad button is starting to not work (I need to push down pretty hard to get it to respond).  The screen and sound are below average.  For $200, it's not bad.  For nearly $300, I'd say look for something else.  I'm OK with my laptop, but will certainly not recommend buying one (nor will I purchase an ASUS laptop in the future).
