Not bad for a cheap laptop
So far ok, Wireless card is very poor, I can be in the same room as my router and only get 3 bars worth of signal. If I put the laptop next the router, I might get 4 bars of signal. When plugged into an Ethernet cord it works perfectly fine. On the plus side the picture is very clear and vivid and most programs work well without any issues. Overall for $150.00 not a bad laptop
