M5Y10 is a deal breaker
I bought this from BB with 8ghz ram and 256ssd  It is a beautiful, thin, light weight, well constructed NB.  It comes with Windows 8.1 with the free Windows 10 upgrade.On first boot I upgraded the UX305 to Windows 10. The upgrade killed the smart gestures, and audio. Smart Gestures were ez enough to reinstall.  Audio, I can't seem to locate the drivers/audio package/amplifier.Without the audio package the speakers are inaudible. Ahh, the lovely m 5y10 processor.  What a dog.  Why did intel make this processor? Reduced power consumption is a worthy goal, but not at the cost of turning performance back to the celeron days.  Besides being painfully slow, the spinning wheel randomly pops up, its annoying and I am not sure what it is accomplishing.The display is good with the matte finish, no reflections, and it can be viewed outside. The automatic adaptive brightness is a major distraction, however it is a windows issue not a hardware.  The hinge is horrible, out of the box it has about .5-inches of play, that will only get worse.8 gig of ram and a 256ssd are impressive, as is the fanless operation. I am not a tech person, but I wonder why all the ram is needed for such a slow processor.The machine has numerous bugs and glitches that are more annoying that debilitating.  Individually they aren't that bad, but the cumulative effect is so frustrating.I don't know how this runs on Windows 8.1.  If it seems ok, then stay away from Win 10 and the hassles associated with drivers, software, etc.This notebook is an upgrade to nothing I have ever owned.
