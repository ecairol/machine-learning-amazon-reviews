... on scrolling up and down but all in all perfect pros: light weight
A little sketchy on scrolling up and down but all in all perfect pros: light weight, very comfortable on lap, it gets warm when connected to charger common, but when it's off no heat, its fast, quite and battery life while using it, is beyond expectations. Im a first time chromebook and I like it.
