Great Chromebook for 3 months.
Given the low price I had very low expectations going in.  So, a 4 Star would have been generous.  Performance is low powered.  I expected about 1 year of service at this price.  No surprise.  But, it is nicely outfitted with USB, HDMI, and SC Card slot.  Speakers are surprisingly good.  But now, less than 4 months later the display is failing.  It has not been dropped, wet, or been handled improperly.  Now opening the case within 15 degrees of fully open creates flickering lines through the screen.  We are now down to 3 Stars.I have searched the web site for a word about a warranty on this device.  Either it doesn't exist or it is just to hard to find.  Now down to 2 Stars.I have searched the web site for a word about getting service on this device.  Either it doesn't exist or it is just to hard to find.  Now down to 1 Star.
