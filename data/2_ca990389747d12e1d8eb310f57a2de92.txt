So far so good. I love this chromebook!
For the price this does exactly what I wanted to. I wanted to edit a website through a browser, browse facebook, get to email and write. Everything is browser based for the most part. Every "app" opens in a new tab. The computer is very straight forward and easy to use. The battery life is just nuts. (12-19hrs on a full charge.)I was going to get a Mac Book Pro/Air but now that I tried this first I realize it would have been a huge waste of money.. Anything that I need to do other than this thing can do, I can do on my desktop PC which I built and upgrade myself so no worries there.My only complaint is the video. When reading words on the tabs or in the file manager, the text looks a little off. Almost like when you haven't installed the proper driver on your Windows based PC. It's a little annoying and only mostly because my eyesight is in decline lately.
