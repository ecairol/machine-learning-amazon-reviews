Avoid ASUS rebates!!!
My advice is to avoid any ASUS product with a REBATE.  The process is hugely time-consuming, with unclear directions. Having spent WAY too much time on the application, I was denied because I believe I sent in the "WRONG" UPC sticker from the multiple ones applied to the box.  Of course, ASUS provides a phone number for questions, but there's no way to reach an actual person - you only get a recording. $100 down the drain! Amazon, I'm a loyal customer who appreciates your top-notch customer service. I'm begging you to reject this whole rebate process, and simply provide the best pricing possible. This hassle is not up to your usual high standards!  Thanks for listening. G.
