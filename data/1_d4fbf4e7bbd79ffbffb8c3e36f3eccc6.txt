This is my favorite thing I own
This is my favorite thing I own!  Really the only laptop I could take from work to home every day.  I have nothing but love for the functionality of this laptop - the only minor issue I have is that even with speakers at their maximum the volume is quite low.  You won't regret this purchase for portability, functionality, and aesthetics.
