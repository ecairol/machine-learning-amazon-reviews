Loving this little powerful laptop
I use it for school (Adobe, Office, Unity, etc.). Overall it's truly excellent, especially for the price.IMPORTANT: Get the version with the i5 processor. The Intel M is crap and can't even overclock over 2ghz. It's worth the $$ to upgrade since you're investing in 8GB RAM anyway, why waste it.Pros:-Battery life-Size and weight (no one wants to carry around a 15.6in laptop every day)-Display resolution and matte - I hate those glossy displays-SSD instead of HDD: of course it boots blazing fast-Lack of touchscreen/2-in-1. Lots of people like this but I find it's useless (I use a Wacom tablet) and the 2-in-1 builds are very susceptible to hardware failure with the flipscreen over time, especially if you carry it everywhere. Unfortunately nearly ALL 14in laptops have this, but it you don't need the touchscreen, excluding it is a pro in my book.Cons:-The screen could get a bit brighter, but this is nitpicky-I wish the SSD was 500GB but again, very minor.Middle-of-the-Road:-Sound is good, pretty loud and clear for a laptop but nothing special-Some bloatware but not nearly as bad as I've seen, and nothing too ad-y-Keyboard is nice but the delete key is near the power key so I disabled the power keyOverall, if you're looking for a powerful, very portable, attractive laptop under $800, choose this. You won't find better at that price.
