Mixed Reviews
I have mixed reviews about this.  I really researched this item and I use Chrome on my laptop, so I felt I was going to be happy with my purchase.  I've had this for 3 days, and the picture is very clear.  I've watched Netflex with happy results.  A very long charge, and most of the time very fast.  But too many times this devise becomes very sluggish and crashes more often than my laptop ever did.  Especially on Words with Friends which I play often,  Its so irritating I'm ready to send it back.  I don't know if I have a "bad" one, or if other people are having the same issue.  I will keep it a few more days and then decide.
