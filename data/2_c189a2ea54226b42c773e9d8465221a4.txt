great buy
this is an extremely attractive notebook for the price, and very light. any linux user should take a look at it. currently running crunchbang on it. while not a powerhouse at all it is more than enough for a linux os. i did not use the windows8 that came with it. from the specs of the machine this i would stay away. while they on paper should run fine, i feel that once you get comfortable with the machine and install all your programs the slowdowns will come crashing in for any geek or heavy user. highly recommend dropping the 8 even if for win7. win8's interface is horrid with no touch also . btw no disc drive so any os installs should be from external sources i.e. ext disc drive or flash drive. all and all this is just an attractively elongated netbook thats easy to carry around for light task or low resource computinrg
