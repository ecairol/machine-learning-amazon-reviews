This is a great laptop for Windows users
This is a great laptop for Windows users. I can't complain much about this laptop because of its relatively cheaper price. However I brought this laptop to install Arch linux system and ultimately I choose to install it with Windows to make a dual boot system.The good things about this laptop is its cheaper price and nice and thin design. Spec is also great when you compare it with other laptops in the market. However as many has already pointed out the biggest issue with this laptop is WIFI connectivity in Linux. I haven't experience any WIFI issues when I m in Windows but in linux always connection drops and I had to use a separate wifi dongle to maintain a stable connection. Also some Fn keys are not properly identified in Linux and advance functionalists of the touch pad like disabling the touch pad while typing is not supported. Hopefully these will be fixed in upcoming kernel releases. Some back-light bleeding is also visible in the laptop I received. Also the average battery hours are much lesser in a linux system. Since this display is FHD in linux you may find all the fonts are very tiny and difficult to read. However there are plenty of workaround for those issues.
