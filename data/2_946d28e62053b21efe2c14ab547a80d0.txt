Best chromebook available Holiday 2015!
Please note this review is for the 2015 HP Chromebook 14 model ak050nr 4gb ramThis Chromebook is the best for the price as of December 2015! Paid $250 at the time I got mine. Make sure to get the 4gb ram model because it also comes with a 1080p IPS display that is worlds better then most Chromebook's TN displays. Ignore the review about the chromebook being underpowered.. This can handle any website you throw at it as well as several tabs without slowing down (referring to the the 4gb ram model) Built quality is great to, good feeling keyboard, plenty light and thin as well, and whisper silent because there is no fan inside. You won't regret this chromebook. My first one came with a bad battery and that's my only complaint, but will get it switched so I'm not concerned!
