Slow and limited outlets
Not a huge fan of this computer.  I got the Pentium i3, they told me it wouldn't make much of a difference since I am using mostly web apps, but it is much slower then my i5.It does not have HDMI and only 2 USB outlets.  It is nearly impossible to find a cord that would connect to an external monitor, and when I did the picture was horrible.I give it the 2nd star because it is small, portable and the touch screen is nice.  Perfect for watching movies on an airplane which I have done a few times.
