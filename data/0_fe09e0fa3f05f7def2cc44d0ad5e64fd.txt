Trackpad issues on all eight of these used in my classroom
I'm a fifth grade teacher and got eight of these Asus Chromebook to use in the classroom.  My initial impressions were that the build quality was good and the performance was smooth using Google Drive.All eight of the Chromebooks have developed issues with the trackpad.  It's always the pressing of the trackpad to click that is the problem.  It takes three to four presses to get the Chromebook to recognize the click.  It's gotten so bad, the students have to use the Chromebook with a USB mouse.These get heavy use in my classroom and have physically withstood the use by the students, but the issues with the trackpad have been discouraging.I also have 8 Acer C720s and those are still working well.
