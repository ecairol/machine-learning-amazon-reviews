To start off the computer is good, for it's price not bad
So here we are, To start off the computer is good, for it's price not bad, the only issue with this is how the plastic is cheap, I know that's how it's supposed to be, but the screen can bend like rubber when I open the screen, otherwise good computer, keyboard is different from others, IT DOES NOT OVERHEAT! Not good for games, lags a bit even with MINECRAFT.
