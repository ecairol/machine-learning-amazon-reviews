Good for the price.
This laptop runs slow at first but once you clean up all the e tea programs it comes with its a decent laptop. One of the downside is that it can't run many programs at once without slowing down drastically. Other than that the size is good. Battery life is decent. Graphics are okay. And for minecraft users who can't afford a fancy laptop if u allocate most of the memory to it when u play it can run at 50 FPS.
