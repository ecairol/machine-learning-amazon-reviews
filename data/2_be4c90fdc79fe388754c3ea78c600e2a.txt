As good as it gets
I've had this notebook for just a few days now, but here are my first impressions:It's almost same size and weight as a 13" Macbook Air, feels very solid, the initial setup was brief, not much bloatware (WildTangent Games comes to mind). The screen is way better than Apple's. The body doesn't get hot. The CPU can easily deal with typical work; however, don't expect to play intensive video games on it, as its integrated video can't do miracles.My conclusions:The good: solid, high-quality build, excellent full HD screen with great viewing angles and color reproduction, great battery life, quiet as a mouse (well, technically quieter, as it has no moving parts, e.g. fans, HDD). Sound quality is great, but max. volume is on the low side; it's ok for a quiet environment (such as an apartment), but not outdoors. ASUS offers a 1 year Accidental Damage Protection for free. The fast CPU and SSD make for a very responsive notebook, with fast boot times and instant program starts.The bad: keyboard not lighted, no touchscreen, Windows 8. There are just time-limited licenses for Microsoft Office and McAfee antivirus.The ugly: Annoying registration process on Asus's webpage for the above mentioned 1 year Accidental Damage Protection.
