Super Super Slow!!!!!!!!
SUPER SUPER SLOW!  Straight out of the box - the CPU was running at almost 100%.  Way too many things running in the background.  It would take 5 minutes to get on the internet and then 2-3 hours to restart because it had updates to do?  No joke! 2-3 hours to restart the computer!  The computer is basically worthless.
