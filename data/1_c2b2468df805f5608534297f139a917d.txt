The keyboard is a nice size and the spaces where you rest your hands ...
I haven't had this Chromebook for long but it's just what I was looking for. As a teacher who uses Google for almost everything at school, the Chromebook was just what I needed. The computer is snappy with multiple tabs loaded, wakes up quickly when opened, and charges quickly. It's very lightweight but doesn't feel cheap. The keyboard is a nice size and the spaces where you rest your hands while typing is soft and smooth. (This was a perk as my old Mac laptop had quite a sharp edge where I rested my hands, it was sometimes painful!) Definitely would recommend this to someone who needs a machine for surfing the web and making the occasional document or spreadsheet.I chose the yellow color and like it. It's a primary yellow shade, not matte or shiny.** Update**After having my Chromebook for only about a month, the mouse and trackpad became buggy and unresponsive. I filled a repair request with ASUS and shipped it off to have it fixed. It was done quickly, in about a week and a half from leaving my hands to returning. The mousepad was completely replaced. Now, a couple of months later, the same issues are reoccurring. I will probably have to send it away again. The computer has not been handled roughly and gets very light use. I am disappointed in what seems to be a "lemon". For this, I've reduced my rating to 3 stars.
