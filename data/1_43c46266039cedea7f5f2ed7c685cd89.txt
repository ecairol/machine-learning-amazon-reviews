Decent
Thought it would be running a litte faster considering the quad core processor and 4gb ram, had to change some settings an appearances down on it for it to run decently. Definitely not bad at al for the price. If you're looking for a laptop for using the internet and watching videos and simple things like that i'd recomend it, definitely not ok for gaming though.
