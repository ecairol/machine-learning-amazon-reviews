Lenovo replacement of defective machine no good
I bought a brand new one of these computers and paid top dollar.  It has a defective shift key.  To get this fixed I have to fill out a ton of paperwork, take it to Kinko's to be returned to Lenovo and do without it until they decide to repair and return it.  To me this means I paid top dollar for a refurbished machine.  I will not buy Lenovo again. Amazon will make the company I purchased from take it back.  Or refund the difference between new and refurbished. Was going to go with the new HP version of this.  You have to go to HP to order - couldn't get through Amazon.  That was my deciding factor.  Good thing.  Between Amazon and company I am not having to deal with Lenovo.  I love the computer just not the manufacturer.  I have been contacted by seller and they are replacing or refunding.  So feel safe to reorder - I think.
