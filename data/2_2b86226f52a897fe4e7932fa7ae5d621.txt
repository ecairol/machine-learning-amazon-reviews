Excellent battery life
Excellent battery life, good display, and surprisingly capable for such a thin, lightweight notebook. On the downside, the touchpad could do with some serious improvement, and it comes with a rather large amount of bloatware pre-installed, which is annoying since the Microsoft store offers the same device without it, for the same price. Overall, an excellent value though.
