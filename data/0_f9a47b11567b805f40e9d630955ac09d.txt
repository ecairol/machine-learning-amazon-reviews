Screen Died Within A Month..
I hate to give a bad review, because I think that my incident was isolated, but my laptop screen blew out within a month.. The battery began to run less and less after about 20 days and on about day 28 the screen went dark. So I returned it, bought a MacBook Pro, much more expensive, but I have owned it about five months and it performs well. With that being said, I have a friend who bought the same exact ASUS and she loves it and it still serves her well.
