Great value for student
It is a great value for student who wants an affordable and useful laptop.I have downloaded Windows 10 before I star to use this tiny laptop.It has touch screen just like using on a tablet, but don't forget it is also a laptop.I love the keyborad and it can be use at the same time with the touch screen. As a student it met all my requirement.The free Office 365 Personal for One Year and a $25 Windows gift card came with the package made me could not be happier.What a great value! I will recommend it to my friends.
