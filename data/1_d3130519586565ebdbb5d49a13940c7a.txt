Amazing laptop. It's so small and thin
Amazing laptop. It's so small and thin, but it doesn't feel flimsy or weak at all. It's nice and sturdy, and it doesn't overheat when I'm using it, even if I have multiple browser windows open or I'm using photoshop. The screen is the perfect size, and the keyboard is very nice to type with. The keys stick out just the right amount, it's well spaced, and it feels nice to type. The body of the laptop is also gorgeous.
