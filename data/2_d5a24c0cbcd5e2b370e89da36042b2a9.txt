I am very happy with this purchase. When I went through the TV selection process, I knew I was looking for a 60+ inch HD Smart TV. I had considered 4K but decided against it since there is not much you can watch in 4K yet. I also spoke with someone that writes for "Wired" magazine who gave me some good tips. I have included below the general summary of why I chose this TV as well as links to websites that can go into much more detail on pros and cons.Summary:Vizio generally has the best bang for the buck. The company produces TVs with good picture quality at a highly reduced price to its competitors. The general consensus is that Samsung will produce slightly better picture quality, but I and others I have spoken with, do not think the price trade-off is not worth it. A comparable TV made by Samsung ("Samsung UN65J6300") will run you about 50% more than this TV. I have looked at the picture on both TVs and was honestly unable to tell a difference. When you buy Vizio, you do need to pay attention to the panels the TV uses because Vizio will use different panels for different sized TVs (of the same model). Basically, the higher Hz numbers in a panel generally equate to improved motion resolution (i.e., reduced blurring). This TV has a 120Hz panel, but if you drop down to the 60-inch, the panel is only 60Hz.  If you are looking for a lot more detail, I have provided below links to some of the review websites I used when making this purchase.I hope this was helpful.http://www.cnet.com/products/vizio-e-series-2015/http://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/by-size/65-inch/bestBest,Dave
