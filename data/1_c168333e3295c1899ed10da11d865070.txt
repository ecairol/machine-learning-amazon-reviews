Maybe my unit is defective
I think my unit is defective. My battery life is really crappy compared to what other people seem to have. It was DOA and I get about 3-4 hours out of this thing full charged. Other than that everything works fine but all I got open atm is YouTube and the screen brightness is all the way down after being full charged and I have about 4 hours remaining -_-
