It's a good starter laptop
It shuts down at the most random times which is SUPER annoying and I wasn't prepared for the whole "no Microsoft" thing, but I've actually come to love Google Docs and all of the other Google things. It's a myth that you can't use this computer without the internet. It isn't the MOST useful without the internet, but it is plausible. It's really good for beginners and people who don't want a lot of hassle.
