Don't plan on enjoying you headphones..if you enjoy music.
Air pad problems....I have 2 iPhones, iPad 3 gen, new air pad.  I have a big problem with the new air pad.  And I have been a big fan of apple products.  If your like me, in the evenings I sit and read and listen to music on my iPad. But,, If you want to listen using ear buds or any headphones, don't get this air pad.  You only hear sound thru the right ear only.  If you fiddle you can get it to work, for the moment, till you touch the plug it will go back to one ear.  I pd $79.00 to get apple care.  So I called, he sent me another Air Pad, it's doesn't work either.  So now, since I got two that don't work, I think they think I'm nuts.  I have apple ear buds, klipsch, Bowers Wilkins, ATH m50s headphones.  All of these work perfectly with my IPhone 4S.  I just can't figure it out, and I'm Very disappointed with the new Air Pad.
