Everything about this laptop was great except for the trackpad
Everything about this laptop was great except for the trackpad. Compared to a Macbook Air, the screen was better, better specs, build quality was great, etc, except the trackpad. At first I thought I could live with it, adjusted the settings to use touch gestures, however it got worse with a few programs I tried. I wasn't able to transfer my Windows version of MS Office that I purchased less than a year ago. So, it made more sense for me to return it and get a refurbished Macbook Air 13. I just needed this for Office and internet access. Ironically, I had no problem transferring my Mac version of Office. So think I would have kept it if I could have used the Windows version of Office I paid for less than a year ago. Of if this had a decent trackpad I would have given it five stars. This is the second time in 3 years I have tried a windows laptop and the trackpad was a deal breaker, although it may be adequate for someone else, depending on what programs you use. It was disappointing because everything else was really good.
