Much lower battery life
I got the developer version of this with the lower resolution screen with 8 GB ram, 128 GB HD, Ubuntu linux.  I was getting frustrated with Apple so thought, well I use linux all day on the desktop, this laptop has awesome battery life, lets give it a try.The screen is nice.  I'm moving from an old macbook pro so really any thing recent should be so.  Has a nice build to it, feels pretty solid, I like the finish of the palm rest.  Smaller and lighter that what I had so overall is nice.Cons:Battery.  I have gotten at most 9 hours out of the thing with just light document editing, this is almost half of what was advertized and is very disappointing.  I really didn't think I'd get 17 hours, but I did expect to get above 10.  I might install windows to see if there is a difference do to OS.  Just really angry with Dell that they basically lied about the battery life.  This is my first Dell and it has not left a positive impression.  I'd say I'm mad about the misrepresentation of the battery life.I keep hitting the trackpad while typing which moves the cursor to where ever the mouse hovering over.  This is really annoying.It has several times now waken from sleep when the cover is closed.  Twice I had it in the sleeve and it did this, running the battery all the way down and practically melting the poor thing.  Sometimes it doesn't wake from sleep.  Basically avoid using sleep to avoid cooking it in your bag or losing all you work.The Ctrl key really should be where the Fn key is in my opinion.Do not have as much control over the dimming of the screen, auto is always on.Otherwise seems a decent machine.  Having used it now for about a month, I think, at least for a laptop, I would have been happier with a Mac.
