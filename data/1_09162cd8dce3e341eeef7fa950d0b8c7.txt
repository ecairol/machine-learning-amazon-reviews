Good for the price.
Great for 18 year old high school grad, shopping for college on a budget. (Unless hes a gamer/nerd/enthusiast)Other than that, you get what you pay for. I think it took about 13 tabs open on chrome to bring this computer to its knee's =/I have seen sales lately, mainly around black friday, of this same computer but with an intel i3, for about 270-300.I'd wait for that if you want something that will last.Still not a bad laptop for the price. I dont think you can find one better for under $300 anywhere (this thing easily destroys a chromebook, although thats not saying much)
