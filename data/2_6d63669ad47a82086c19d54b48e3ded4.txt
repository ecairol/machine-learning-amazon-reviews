Pretty good for it's price
My friends consider me a power user based on the type of operations i'm always running on my desktop and my other laptops, and they know the specifications i'm looking for when it comes to my builds. So they were kinda blown out of the water when i told them i was gonna purchase this laptop. The reason i bought this was merely out of curiosity to be honest, wanted to see if a low budget laptop could get me through the day doing basic applications and so forth. I think this laptop is a great piece of technology for it price tag, if you are on a budget you should try this out. It's not a touchscreen nor does it have optical drive. but it's light and easy to carry around when you're on the go. Oh, in case you're are wondering, i've tried playing a few games from my steam account on this, CS, L4D, KILLING FLOOR, street fight iv at low-med specs, while some of my other games didnt work, but that's not the purpose of this purchase. the keyboard layout is nice i my opinion, keys are well spaced and a numpad is included. kinda wish there lights to indicate CAPS lock and NUM lock. i'm not a fan of the touchpad so i purchased a wireless mouse to accompany this and the battery life is fairly decent for it's price. I'm still going through the gears with it, this just my 3rd day with it so if i notice anything else i'll update my post.
