Failed promise
When it works, it's great. There are enough quirks that frustrate me, and have dramatically reduced its utility. Regardless of price, if I'm not using something, it wasn't worth it.Here are the significant problems with it:* It can't find my TV in its database. So I have to power it up manually.* It gets hot, and then stops responding. To watch a movie through Netflix, I have to place a full cup of ice on top of it to keep it cool. This is regardless of how much air it has around it.* The remote must be shaken to have it understand its new orientation. Just rotating it is almost never enough.When it works, it's fine, but the above complaints are significant that they pretty much ruin the overall experience.
