Buyer be where
I don't blame the seller,  We bought 2 of these after much research. My disappointment came after making the purchase and found these particular units do not come with a dvr player. The onse a read about did. It is also amazing with some ads this model is 5g capable for wifi. Buyer be ware, I did not know retailers had the ability to resell watered down versions. One should remember if it's too good to be true!!!!!!
