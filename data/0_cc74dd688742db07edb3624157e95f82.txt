Terrible screen display
I bought my Dell XPS 13 few weeks ago, February, 2015.  I am very disappointed.  The screen display is terrible.  The display screen is a non-glossy screen.  So, it does NOT come out sharp and crispy color display as a glossy screen.  The Dell never mentioned this model is non-glossy.  I purchased assuming this XPS 13 come with glossy display since it was advertised as a home computer.  Big mistake.  Dell failed to disclosed more information.  Be careful buying this laptop.  I will not purchase laptop from online again.  I recommend you check out laptop at store before buying from online.  Make sure you know what you want.
