Disappointing
On the surface, this is a good laptop, especially for the price. However, the computer hangs very frequently, even in the first few days after I got it. It was much too slow for a new laptop. An IT Technician refreshed the OS for me, removing all of the installed software, to see if that would help. Still no luck. Worked a little better for a while, but it has gone back to hanging up all the time. I am going to try to wipe the Hard Drive completely. If that doesn't help, I'm going to have to get rid of it.Pros:1. It is VERY light, especially for its size2. The price is excellent for what you're supposedly getting3. The keyboard has a num padCons:1. The trackpad, especially the associated buttons are not responsive enough2. Computer is slow and hangs up very often
