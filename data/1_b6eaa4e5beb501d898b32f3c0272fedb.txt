READ BEFORE BUYING!!!
This computer overall is great! it runs fast! ships fast! etc. but the company and seller lied to you and try to make an extra buck! I bought this pc to play games and stream movies! it could handle all of that but my friend wanted me to put some music on a cd! I could see the disk drive on the side but it didn't seem to have a button on it? strange. So I look all over the internet and I checked the settings and there was nothing. So I looked in the manual and what do I find? A DISK DRIVE WITH BUTTONS ON IT!!!!!! So I called customer support and the man asked for the serial number. I gave it to him. And he said" this computer does not have a disk drive and I was furious! So beware buyer, this computer has a useless piece of plastic on it. Thank you asus.(they don't deserve to be capitalized)
