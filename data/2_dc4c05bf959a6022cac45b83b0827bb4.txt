Great Product for Surfing, email and social Media
this is a great device particularly for surfing the Web, email and social media.  Not so good for using various programs since the operating system is new and there are few versions of various programs for this operating system at this time, like Sketchbook which was one of the reasons I bought it this device,  so that was disappointing.  but it is great for the uses I mentioned.
