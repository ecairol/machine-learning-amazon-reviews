So far, so good. It's taking me a little bit to get used to but overall I like it. One reviewer mentioned the closeness of the right and left click buttons of the mouse pad being to close together and there is a "fine line" between them and I have to agree. In addition they are too small. I have difficulty when using the mouse pad for cut and paste activities. It is very fast and serves it's purpose for me as a graduate student. I didn't read carefully enough to see that it did not have Microsoft office pre-installed so I had to get the PC download for it since it doesn't have a dvd/cd drive. That wasn't a big deal though because I found a 4 yr subscription for students and it downloaded very quickly. I would just suggest that they make the mouse pad a bit more user friendly but other than that I am happy with the purchase.
