Price great, wifi bad, trackpad worse, lid limited how far it can be opened
So far, this thing is marginal.  Looks nice, is solid.  Wifi problems regularly in first 48 hours, cutting out regularly.  Trackpad blows big time.  I just downloaded the ASUS trackpad drivers and now I don't have to click it as often which helps.  Still this trackpad is clunky at best.  So far attempts to go to Win 10 with all updates installed has been futile.  The key update needed is not being installed by Windows update and the tool Microsoft provides flags this.  How to get it ? wait says Microsoft.  Other issues, power button in bizarre location on keyboard above the backspace. The light there also which indicates sleep, power etc. confuses me regularly.  Oh and the silly raising of the base of the laptop when the lid is opened completely is just plain dumb.  If on slippery surface once the lid lifts the laptop off the surface it slides all over the place.  And if you are at a location where you are much higher than the laptop and want to open the lid more than about 120 degrees you can't.  This thing won't open all the way up or even to a reasonable distance past where you would use it if it was in your lap.  I never saw this as a problem before but now keep running into it.  I'm pretty sure this thing is going back but I'll try for a few days and see if it doesn't grow on me cause the price is FANTASTIC.
