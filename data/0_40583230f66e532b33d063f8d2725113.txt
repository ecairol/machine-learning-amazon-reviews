HiI purchased this laptop 6 months ago, and at the beginning it worked properly, however after a few weeks the laptop would keep rebooting and restarting by itself. The laptop would restart and not function for up to 24 hours causing my a lot of delay and frustration. I tried to return it, but the return window is closed. What can I do with this non-functioning laptop?
