ASUS Doesn't Honor Warranty
I purchased this to use as a light weight travel laptop. It worked great for a month, until it suddenly stopped charging. I contacted ASUS warranty support and they had me send it in after their battery reset didn't work. They claimed that there was water damage to the unit which damaged the keyboard and motherboard and that the warranty would not cover this. However I had never had any issues before this, and before I sent it in, I was able to turn on the laptop, it just gave me a low battery message and then would turn off. I don't believe that a fried motherboard would be able to do that. It was packaged inside two different boxes when shipped, so it would be impossible that it got water damage during shipping.The real kicker was when they quoted me to fix the unit. ASUS quoted me $280 to fix the motherboard and keyboard, which is $120 more than it would cost me to just buy a new unit. That is absolutely ridiculous. If I would have known that they weren't going to honor the warranty, I would have just saved the $20+ in shipping to California and trashed the unit. Maybe I'll be able to sell the charger once they return the unit since as other people say, buying a new charger is almost more than buying a new chromebook. I had planned on buying my family chromebooks for the holidays, but I most certainly won't be buying ASUS chromebooks, or any ASUS products again for that matter.
