poor keypad and needs a USB mouse - otherwise great
It's fast, but here are the two downsides: (1) on the keyboard, the power key is where the "delete" key usually is, so when you want to hit "delete," you end up powering off your computer; and, (2) the trackpad is incomprehensible, no rhyme or reason as to when or how it's going to move in response to your input. Otherwise, it's great. So, try to retrain your habitual typing and buy a USB mouse (?)
