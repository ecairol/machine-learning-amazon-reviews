The best iPad yet!
My first iPad was fun-I called it my toy. I also called it "the brick". I used & enjoyed it for certain things. Now several more iPad down the road I have the iPad Air & I am in love! I read a LOT & I went through various Kindle devices-from the original to the Paperwhite as well as the Fire HD & HDX. They all went back to the store after much disappointment & I would go back to reading on the Kindle App.The iPad Air has become my mini workstation, paired with an Apple wireless keyboard, my library, my entertainment zone where I watch movies, play games & listen to music. I can also shop, do research-the list is endless! The device is as light as air even with a leather cover. It stays cool-no overheating. It is fast & with 128g, there is room for what interests me. The Retina screen is gorgeous-which as a professional photographer who uses it as a portfolio to show my work is a must.Apple, you did a fabulous job!
