Though this computer looks lovely, mine has been plagued with problems since purchasing it six months ago. First, the power cord snapped (yes, snapped). Now, apparently the port is faulty and the computer won't charge. To fix my six month old computer, I have to send it to Asus, and will likely be without a computer for three to four weeks. Dealing with customer service was a nightmare. First, their system was down, and I was told to call back when they could actually process a repair order. Then, my call was disconnected repeatedly. No apologies for the inconvenience, no option to expedite the process, nothing. Save yourself the headache of dealing with this computer and this company and purchase a mac book, so atleast you have the option of going to Genius Bar. The extra money is worth it.
