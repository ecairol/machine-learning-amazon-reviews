Gave this product an honest try, despite the reviews
I purchased this google box to replace my Logitech Revue.  First off, set up was extremely difficult. After purchasing an additional dual IR blaster and many set up attempts it finally worked, somewhat.  It appears that if you have multiple components that are not right next to each other, you will have to get a dual IR.  In order to control your components, the remote requires line of sight.The quality of the remote is very shoddy, feels really cheap. After setting up with my Directv, Sharp Aquos 70 LED and Vizio 210SBSW, instead of muting when I pushed mute, it would magically change the Directv channel to channel 7.  I thought It was possible component set up for the Directn box.  I tried different codes and still would do the same thing.  The wi fi is completely horrible.  It lost connection all the time.  I almost set up an AP just for the Hisense.About 3 weeks later the remote completely stopped working, so I thought. I even had the iPhone app Goggle Remote, that no longer could connect to the box.  I hard reset the box and replaced the batteries.  After reset, the box would no longer pair with the remote.  The box itself felt a lot warmer than I noticed before. I suspect it overheated.  Needless to say I thought I was SOL.  Amazon was great.  They accepted the return, even though it was nearly a month old.Usually when people on here give a poor review on something its because they just are technically inept.  I gave this product an honest try with a lot of patience.  I went ahead and replaced this with the Vizio CoStar.  So far so good.  Set up was much easier and the remote uses the IR blasters of the actual component, so no need for extra blasters.  The remote feels a lot nicer.  Its only been a couple of weeks so far but it has been a much better experience.
