A miniscule computer
I tried this and ended up returning it. It felt too delicate to me; I did not care for the seemingly flimsy keyboard. It seemed to work perfectly well, though, for what it is. Perhaps if you walk around a lot and you need a computer that is unbelievably lightweight, and don't plan on running many programs outside of Word and maybe some music, then I would recommend this device.
