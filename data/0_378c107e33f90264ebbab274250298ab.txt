Keyboad went bad afe abou a monh
NOE: his eview is being written on the laptop itself. All missing letters are due to the unresponsiveness of the keyboard. I own the black 13.3 inch, 2gb RAM edition.PROS:- ChromeOS is geat. I's ery easy to us and takes very little efort to do even the smallest tasks. As a sotware engineer, I appreciae this type o design.- the battery life is incredible. Wow. It was no a surprise at all to get 12-14 hours of regular use from it.- So lightweight. It's maybe en percent heavier than my tablet. I love this.- All flash. No moving parts means no noise, no annoying fans, and more duability.CONS:- he keyboard went out after about 30 days. Maybe one in 30-40 keys jus never regisers a click. Nothing was ever spilled on the lapop and I have reinsalled the OS muliple imes.- he screen is not amazing. It (hey my T key is back! Yay!!!) isn' very brigh (oh is gone again) nor does i ge very dim. Bu for mos uses, he sceen works jus fine.
