Lasted  7 months
I bought this in Nov, 2014, I loved it !! Worked great, and was pretty fast on startup.It did the automatic Windows update yesterday and I got the blue screen of death!! Gave me an error code Oxc000000f.After researching what this code was, a message popped up and said my pc was broke and needed repair.Saw that it is a costly repair and decided to smash it with a hammer!  Now its really dead!Claims I needed to reinstall the original software, don't have and didn't make a disc ( my bad)Will be replacing this with a Chrome book this week.No more Windows for me!!
