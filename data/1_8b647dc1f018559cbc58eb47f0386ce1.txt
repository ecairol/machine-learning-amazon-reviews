Almost a year and still a workhorse..
I bought this in the fall of 2014.  I decided to wait and see if there was anything odd that happened to it.  This is a really great laptop for the price!! Overall I am very pleased with it.  Here is my overall assessment:Pros:Windows 8.1 is really nicePriceVery LightI used this laptop to connect via an HDMI to a TV set to stream NetflixCons:Touch Pad and Key board are not as precise and sensitive as I would likeNot very upgradableI bought mine without the CD/DVD - bought an external DVD drive and the computer did not recognize some older games with the external driveSound driver seems to have issues intermittently -the sound appears to have trouble switching back to the internal laptop speakers when disconnected from external speakersPlays some games; however the graphics card is very basic and cannot play some older games and some newer games (I loaded the older Age of Empires, Bejeweled).Overall this has been a great laptop to surf, do work from home (have MS Office loaded) and it also enables me to do some art programs for recreation including Adobe Suite 2015 and some older desktop publishing software.
