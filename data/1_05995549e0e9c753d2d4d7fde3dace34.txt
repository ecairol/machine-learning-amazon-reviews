Great deal with minor issues per previous complaints
It's a great deal for a solid laptop. I was super impressed by how lightweight it is. Battery life ~5-6 hours is good enough too. After 2 weeks, major issues thus far are 1) display driver crashing once a day, causing screen to momentarily go black. 2) mousepad with a mind of its own. Every so often, my browser will automatically magnify to 250% or shrink upon a slight touch. 3) screen auto-dimming suddenly even after switching off Enable Adaptive Brightness under advanced power plan. It happens when I switch between applications (i.e. Spotify to Browser).The mousepad problem can be fixed with a $20 workhorse wireless mouse I have from LG. For the first problem, I just installed a generic graphic display driver from Intel's website per a previous customer's comments (delete the existing driver first). We'll see how this goes. The screen auto dimming problem only happens once or twice a day, only with switching from Spotify to browser, so it may be an isolated issue.These 3 issues are all more annoyances than deal-breakers, as they minimally affect what I need the computer to do. 2 seem fixable, so overall I'm still happy with this guy!
