DO NOT BUY THIS!
I really don't understand the people saying that this is a good product for low money!!! It is not at all!!!!I bought this computer on the 23rd of January, it is now the 27th and it already broke down. Whenever I try to start it all it gives me is a black screen with nothing then my cursor on it. That's it. I can not use it at all. I really needed a good laptop for school, but this is just the biggest failure on earth. I've read some reviews on google saying that this product always has these problems I just mentioned!! So I am definitely not the only one! I will return this product tomorrow and better spend 200$ more for a good working laptop than spending 300$ for absolutely NOTHING!Biggest waste of money ever! I repeat: Do not buy this product!!!
