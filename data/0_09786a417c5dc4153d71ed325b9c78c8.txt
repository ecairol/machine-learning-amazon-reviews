Don't do it! I thought I had a decent chance of getting a good product despite the reviews (10% 1-stars, but for very specific problems). Came out of the box, lifted the screen and it feel all the way back. Sleek, beautiful, seemed relatively fast and responsive, but very very cheaply made. Returned immediately - as I understand the customer service can be a nightmare.!
