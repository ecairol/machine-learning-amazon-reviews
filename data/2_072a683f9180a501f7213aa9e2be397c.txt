So far I love it. loads fast
Just getting used to it.  Never had a laptop and I have used chrome on my pc and phone but have to get used to non microsoft system.  So far I love it.  loads fast.  hooks itself to the wifi with little or no assistance.  Only works with internet.  But that what I wanted this for so its great.  Very inexpensive
