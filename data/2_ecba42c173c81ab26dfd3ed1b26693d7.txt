A great affordable, yet powerful
A great affordable, yet powerful, ultrabook for those who want to just run Linux without a Windows boot.Running Ubuntu-Gnome, and was surprised at the battery life, I got 6 hours off a full charge doing random basic tasks (ie. word-processing, internet, music, a few YouTube videos). That is the best battery life I have ever seen a Linux laptop get, as it is a power-hungry OS (installed and configured PowerTop too, which probably helped).Also no problem with installation, did not have to disable Secure Boot or activate legacy BIOS. Those running non-Ubuntu based distros might have to work a little harder for it.Hardware worked completely out of the box, aside from the Brightness keys, which is a common issue, and can be controlled through Gnome anyway.
