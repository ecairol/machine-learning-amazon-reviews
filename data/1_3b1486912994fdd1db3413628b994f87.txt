Cheap and great for everyday functioning!
For it's price, great. My computer freezes when I'm doing multiple things at once and have numerous browsers which I didn't think should've been a problem because it has adequate RAM, but oh well. Other than that, I would say a good cheap buy for daily use.Pros:CheapLight and durableGreat soundGreat battery lifeWindows 8.1Cons:Freezes when too many things are runningGetting used to Windows 8.1 when it's NOT a touch screenNot the best for for high quality graphics
