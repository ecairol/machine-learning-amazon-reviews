Great battery life, does almost everything!
Really good stuff! Great battery life! Can do almost everything I do on my regular computer. Runs super cool. Arrived on time and in perfect new condition! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that Facebook sometimes gets stuck and I suspect it might be due to memory issues. Besides that, everything is great.
