Love them so much I'm buying an extra set to leave at work!
The apple type earbuds hurt my ears and never stay in, drives me nuts. I got these ones about a year ago and I have had to mic issues as others have and I love them. They fit in my ear so well I don't need to use them loopy being your ear peice. They almost work to good, sometimes I put them on at work and with the volume relatively low people sneak up on me really easily.I would recommend giving no these a try
