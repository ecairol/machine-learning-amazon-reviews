which was a very good thing. Unfortunately
I received it today, a day ahead of time, which was a very good thing. Unfortunately, it does not support Google's cast extension, which is the main reason I bought it. Google OS, Google browser, Google app, Google extension, yet they don't work together. So my initial rating is going to be low, because it is unsuited to my purpose. May be unfair, but that's the deal.
