Nice
I got this for a decent price and use it all day everyday. the one thing that bothered me is the zoom with the mousepad-- you need to disable it or the "pinch" will cause the zoom to go in and out repeatedly. Another issue was connectivity and slowness--- which others stated. I put AVG 1 click maintenance on it and bought a new modem. This seems to have solved the issues. I did notice that when trying to modify my website, the site will freeze. I solved this by clearing the cache in google chrome. For the price, it does what i like. As far as Windows 8, you can remove the apps you dont like. i acutally like it.
