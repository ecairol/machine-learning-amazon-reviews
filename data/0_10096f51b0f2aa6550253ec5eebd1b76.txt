The computer works fine, NOW
The computer works fine, NOW.  It came full of viruses that I had to pay to have removed and then when I contacted them for help, they tried to sell me a very expensive virus protection, etc.  I just didn't understand how a new computer came equipped with viruses.  That part was very disappointing.
