Great little Chromebook for $200 (4GB model)
Great little Chromebook for $200. The 4GB model zips along the web great. Great looking design and solid build. The track pad on this is very accurate with gestures and tap-to-click, which leads me to believe the trackpad problems on Asus' WIndows laptops are Microsoft's fault. If they could make an 8GB/64GB model of this with an Intel chip, better quality display, and running Windows 10, I'd be all over it. I really like the 11" form factor of this. It's much like a low budget 11" Macbook Air. The only thing I can gripe about is the display, since it's pretty much bad unless you're looking at it head on. I'd pay $400-$500 for a premium Windows version of this little guy. If you're looking for a super portable, get-on-the-web-in-a-split-second laptop that's not a tablet, this is a great option for $200.
