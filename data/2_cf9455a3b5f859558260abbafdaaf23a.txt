A really nice TV it's perfectly perfect.
It looks really nice in my bedroom! I have a 4K 50 inch upstairs in my living room so the quality of this TV compared to that one is obviously not the same however it's still a really nice TV for the price! And you got a love Amazon prime for that free shipping free two-day shipping!
