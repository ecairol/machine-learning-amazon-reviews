Keys stopped working...
My 14 year-old son saved up for a long time to buy this computer.  He was so excited as this was his first laptop, and his first major purchase.  For the first 4 months the computer worked fine.  Then, he turned it on 2 days ago and several of the keys would not work (s,3,5,6,7,0,`,=,del). He was upset when he found out that some of the keys would not work.  It's hard to log on when one of the keys you need does not work!  It is past the return period to return to Amazon so it looks like we will have to send the computer in for repair. It seems to me that after producing millions of keyboards... a keyboard issue would be the last of anyone's worries.  But, here we are.  The only choice we have at this point is to send the computer in to Asus for repair.  Very disappointed!
