Great Purchase, More than I expected
Bought this laptop as a travel laptop, as I did not want to carry the bulky HP I have at the office. So far, this laptop has lived up to my expectations. The screen is better than I expected, very sharp and rich and clear. Performance is excellent, came with Win 8.1, no lags, no delays. Well designed overall. I chose this size because it's bigger than a tablet, smaller than large laptop, and can use it multiple modes: laptop, tablet, touch, etc. Can easily be used in airplanes, on the fly, and always ready since no need to wait for booting, loading, ...BTW, the charger is also smaller than the usual laptop charger... I would want a whole 8 hours without a charger, but this is an acceptable compromiseSome drawbacks are battery life, wish it could last all work day, so I don't have to carry a charger from the hotel to wherever I am. Also, the keyboard takes getting used to, but we'll see after a while.
