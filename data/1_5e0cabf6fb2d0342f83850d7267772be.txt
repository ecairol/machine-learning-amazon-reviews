Great for Travel
I use this laptop as my main home computer.  Just found out today that I can't run a simple point and click adventure game on it, so that is where it's losing a star. :(I've had this for about a year and it has held up quite well.  I use it as a tablet often, and there is no wear to the hinges with me twisting it back and forth so much.  I use the laptop for visiting the web, checking email, word and excel documents, and not much more, so I can't comment on the memory or speed for gaming...but as I mentioned about trying to play one game - this is obviously not a gaming computer.It's really lightweight which makes it great for bringing on trips, using on the couch, or taking with me to and from work. The touchscreen works perfectly for me, never any issues there.  In the beginning I was typing on the wrong keys often, this is due to previously using a regular sized keyboard all the time.  Now, I'm used to it and can switch back and forth from my work desktop and keyboard to this laptop.
