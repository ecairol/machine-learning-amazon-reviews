Awesome purchasse
I'm a former Network admin, used all HP products, except I purchased a Lenovo for VP of IT; wanted a lightweight laptop and I purchased a Lenovo, when it came time to buy myself a new laptop, I looked at this lenovo, for lightweight and battery usage. This laptop alone was worth the money... But to have a flippable tablet that is so smooth was amazing... BUY IT...
