Love the long battery life...
*update* Just at the 30 day mark this device turned into a headache. It no longer connects via bluetooth and the clock and calendar are off. This device won't accept a usb connection to my phone anymore, either! I hope amazon will allow a return. I don't want to exchange this for an identical device, as it will more than likely have the same sort of glitches.It took awhile to get used to, but it eventually grew on me. I rated it at 4 or 5 stars because of the excellent battery life. It was also my opinion that this would be perfect for students, as it's not only priced right, but most of our kids' work revolves around Google now anyway.The eventual problems I've had it with, however, are more than a tad upsetting as this is seeming like a big waste of money. I've made a lot of purchases from amazon over the years, and this is sure to be my last if I end up stuck with this chromebook.
