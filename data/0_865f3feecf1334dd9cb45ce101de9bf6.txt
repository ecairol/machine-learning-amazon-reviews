DONT DO IT if you stream media and want alot of app variety.  the apps arent functioning no matter how much u upgrade ios
If you stream media, buyer beware.  Every single cable tv app I have sticks at commercials and so does hulu.  I am not sure whether its ios or just the fact that apple cannot handle it, or the app makers suck?  I had an asus t100 that worked and streamed well and aside from construction it processed better.  The kindle fire hdxmy  daughter has works better.  and its constructed well and kid friendly.  Android has more variety and less issues with apps as well.I do not recommend this product unless you want an overpriced apple compatible device.  I have used windows all my life and I will continue to use it and now wish I would have spent my money on the Samsung 10.1.  the ten hour charge DOES NOT HOLD if you use the ipad, for media, try 6 hours.  Now I have to go back to my hpb3eats edition touchscreen to watch popcorn time or saved media.This product is a waste, overpriced and like buying Versace to wear on a farm instead of levi's which are functional.  And wisdom is worthless if it doesn't function well.also apps on kindle and android are more reasonably priced.  as well as more effective when being used.  If Samsung or kindle could get the design and metal look, then apple would go bankrupt.  As I tap the screen on my ipad so sci fi will move on to the show because all comercials make all the apps stick.  is the tv like this?  if you have apple tv?  wow....I say as I am typing this review on my hp laptop.  with working functional windows 8
