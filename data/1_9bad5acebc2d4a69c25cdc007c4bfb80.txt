Not Bad, Great Timing
I'm not a computer techy, so I'm not sure how accurate my review is going to be. However, I thought I'd mention that it seems to work very well, although some of the games like to crash - not sure if that's the computer or not. I can't speak for the effectiveness of the Wi-Fi, unfortunately, as my house is very good at blocking it as soon as you enter a different room. One of the only things that really annoys me functionality-wise is the touch pad. It works just fine, but there's no scroll on the side, and it's hard to tell at first that there are left and right click buttons. They're fused with the rest of it, with only a little white line giving any indication. When I first pressed on it I thought I was going to break it. But it works just fine. The other annoying aspect of this is that the battery seems to drain really fast. I don't play intense games (just Mahjong and the Microsoft Puzzle game), but I am on the internet a lot. I tend to just keep the laptop plugged in most of the time.
