It's easy and streamlined
I just purchased this TV from Costco last night. If anything of substance changes, I'll take the time to post an update.Things worthy of note:- It is much more convenient to be able to watch digital media directly on the TV than it is to have a Roku, Chromecast or Wii. It's easy and streamlined. I was hesitant about it using the Yahoo! Apps but it seems to be OK. Decent selection of apps. You do need to have Spotify Premium to use Spotify on this TV.- My remote came with the three programmed buttons of Amazon Instant, Netflix and iHeartRadio. Obviously I would prefer them to be Netflix, Hulu Plus and HBOGo, but I suppose that you can't please everyone. It would have been nice if you can reprogram them to your desired channels.- BIG CON: There is a buzzing noise that comes from our TV when it's on. It's quiet enough that you don't hear it when you're watching anything with sound, but when there isn't sound, it can be heard even from the other room. This might be a defect with my specific TV. I will update this review if the noise stops or changes.- The picture and sound are great for my purposes.- Our router/modem happens to be right next to our TV stand, so I do have a wired connection set up. I notice it being slightly faster in load times than wireless, of course, but it doesn't make a huge difference.- I think the TV is worth the money, but I think that I'll return mine to Costco if the buzzing doesn't go away.- I also posted this review on Costco's website, FYI.
