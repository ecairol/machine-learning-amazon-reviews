ASUS Zenbook might be better off running LINUX
With the proper operating system, this ASUS Zenbook shines.  The display is clear, bright, and sharp over a wide range of viewing angles.  Sound reproduction is adequate, quite amazing timbre from such a thin case.  Battery life is dependent on app load, but will satisfy most users with a nominal 6 hours.  The SSD drive seems smallish, but for recreational use it will service your needs.  Wireless connectivity is a breeze to set up and maintain.  The ASUS is so light in weight, it can be carried anywhere, and it won't give you eyestrain staring at tiny 4-inch screens.  About the only caveat is the POWER switch key, located on the far right-hand side of the keyboard; it is possible to switch OFF by accident, thus losing all your work, unsaved.You get all this while running LINUX off a bootable thumb drive.  This review actually is a commentary of Win8/10 and the suspected effects on SSD drives, the dreaded DPC_Watchdog_Violation.  This blue-screen-of-death issue occurs in laptops with standard hard drives, but solid state drives (SSD) seem to aggravate the issue.The typical culprits are display driver incompatibilities, though practically any added device in the USB chain can trigger the mutt violation.  Thesuggested fix is re-installation of display and/or device drivers.  However, the fix is only temporary; the problem will re-occur, sometimes within afew days of applying the supposed cure.The only permanent solution appears to be switching from Win8/10 to Fedora or Ubuntu.  Either one will tame the mutt permanently.  It you havenever tried a LINUX distribution, try booting from a thumb drive carrying a LINUX flavor.  There will be sufficient space on the SSD drive tohouse Win10 and much more useful LINUX.Thumbs down on any device running Win10.  The DPC Watchdog Violation issue almost drove me to a Mac, after thirty years of loyalty to DOS and Windows.
