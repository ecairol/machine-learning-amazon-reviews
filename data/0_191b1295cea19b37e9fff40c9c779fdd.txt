Long lasting battery, but not compatible with a lot of things..
Make sure you think about what you need it for..Battery seems to last for ever.. doesnt overheat like the other 3 laptops Ive had.. Very fast processing, great for video streaming (YouTube,etc...)One huuuuuge con toughhalf the apps,/messangers do not work on here including Skype!, You have to use google plus.. You have to download google apps, half the time .. esp. when downloading/uploading photos..If I knew that the google system wasnt compatible with so many things, I would have not got it.. If you just want a laptop as a gift for someone who is just gonna read/watch vids online... this would be good.. but if you want to back up your work, or upload photos,.. its gonna be a pain..More than anything I like the fact that even after 6 hours of constant video watching it is barely hot to the touch..having to download google apps, is a major pain..Update:After about 2 months of use, the keyboard started becoming screwy... the mouse pointer would disappear,  whenever you get to the typing something, the letter s would get stuck on and I couldnt find a way to turn it off...it would just go like sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssthen about 3 days after that the keyboard crapped out completely..I checked Amazon warranty thingy, and its says they dont really cover the keyboard at all, and the usual warranty is like 30 days or something anyway...So I had to update my rating.. and NO I did not spill anything on the keyboard... its just crapped out..Ive had other laptops like Acer, and their keyboard worked great but the screen went black... always something.. its seems you cant get a decent laptop under $800 these days.
