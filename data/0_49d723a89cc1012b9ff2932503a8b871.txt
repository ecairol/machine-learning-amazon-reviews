Decent chromebook, impossible to find replacement charger with square plug
Bought this for my daughter, worked fine, but the dog chewed up the power cord. Normally I wouldn't rate an item based on accessories, but the only replacement power cord I could find was $80 (half the price of the device) due to the proprietary square-ish plug. It's not the typical round one. Frustrating when a nice device is turned into an expensive brick, I'll just get another chromebook with a typical plug.Other than that, it was decent at playing videos from a USB drive but limited in what codecs it could use.
