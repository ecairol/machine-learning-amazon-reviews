I bought this laptop when I began a doctorate program recently.  It is very lightweight and sleek and very fast but honestly there is something holding me back from giving it 5 stars.  I have had a few occurrences where my screen will go black and a pop up will say that a driver crashed and has been recovered.  I have not had an issue with that other than it is just a bit annoying.  All in all I do enjoy this laptop a lot and would recommend it.
