Perfect for my High School kid
Perfect for my High School kid. Not the fastest but it's OK. Beware that to get any  warranty info. is impossible unless you call Taiwan. The power button shorts out now after almost a year and cannot make contact with ASUS. It will cost $80.00 to get fixed, Almost half the price paid. Oh well, won't be buying an ASUS again, ever :{
