This Dell just made a life-long Windows user switch to Mac
After using the Dell XPS 13 since Feb 2015...The screen is one of the best on a laptop that I've ever used, taking into consideration the bezel-less aspect of it of course.Powerful enough to do 1080P video editing/rendering on Sony Vegas Pro.I am a power user. With screen brightness at the absolute lowest (the screen doesn't turn completely off at the lowest setting if your wondering) and not editing or rendering video, I get no more than 8 hours of use, ave 7 hours.I had to return the laptop twice for repairs. 1. The cpu fan spun at max rpm when computer is on (they replaced the fan) 2. The trackpad stopped working (they re-seated the trackpad instead of replacing it like I wanted them to). At the time of this review, I am still having issues with the trackpad and I am not alone. There are plenty of 1 star reviews for this laptop. I recommend reading the top review entitled "What good is a Ferrari with a broken steering wheel," although the title is self explanatory.I am giving this product 1 star at the time of this review because I am writing out of frustration due to the hardware issues. My actual rating should be closer to a 2 or 3 IF I imagined that it had no hardware issues to begin with and that I didn't have to send it back to Dell twice and still the same issue persists. ALSO, It would have been great if I wasn't expecting 10+ hours of battery life, considering the advertised life is 15 hours.I bought this laptop for work and because of the customer service experience and the hardware issues...I didn't know this was possible, but I am considering switching to a MacBook for my next PORTABLE computer. I've been a Windows user my whole life... For better or for worst, thank you Dell? This may be a blessing in disguise.Another note: Computer has trouble booting up from time to time
