Perfect for the active student or busy professional.  If you are using EXTREME graphics, check out the ASUS ROG.
The Asus Zenbook features ultra portability for the active student or busy executive. A benefit of the Zenbook is the very quiet operation and lack of heat buildup due to not having physical drives, this also helps immensely with energy conservation allowing the Zenbook longer operating time between charges. With Windows 8.1 on a solid state drive, boot up and shutdown occur in mere seconds.The left side features 2 USB 3.0 ports and an SD card slot. The right side features a headphone / microphone jack, micro HDMI, a 3rd USB 3.0, and a power jack. Like many new laptops, use the USB port to recharge a cell or tablet even when the laptop is powered off.Ultra lightweight at barely a pound, super sleek, thinner than most tablets. Very responsive physical keyboard (far better than using a Bluetooth keyboard.)The Zenbook is superb for surfing, watching videos, editing documents and spreadsheets, etc.  It suitable for editing audio tracks while it is moderately suitable for photo editing, light video editing, etc.  If you are into HEAVY graphics then I recommend the ASUS ROG series of laptops. Otherwise, the Zenbook should be ideal for most routine laptop usage.Overall I am very impressed with the Zenbook and highly recommend it for especially the busiest of professionals or students.
