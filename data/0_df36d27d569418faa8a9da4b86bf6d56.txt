Was NOT Impressed...
Took the day off so i could set this laptop up for my wife. Wasn't too impressed. Slow moving laptop with NO Optical Drive even though the description said there was.(Since corrected after numerous complaints i assume) I am now using it for basic e-mails, etc. If your looking for a fast laptop or one to stream videos from, keep looking and good luck.
