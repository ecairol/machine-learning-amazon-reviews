Amazing battery life- I never bring my charger with me ...
Pros:Amazing battery life- I never bring my charger with me because this laptop easily lasts 12+ hours with heavy use.Great keyboard- keys are nicely spaced and easy to press, I'm comfortable typing on it after using Apple my whole life.Extremely portable- this is one of the thinnest, lightest Chromebooks on the market, and I can carry it anywhere.Cons:Not the fastest- if I open 9+ tabs at once I notice a little bit of slow down, it has never froze on me though.Plastic design- mine clicks in the plastic hinge, but it doesn't affect functionality.Speakers- really, really quiet, I can only use them in a quiet room without distractions.Overall, I like this little beast for schoolwork. For the price I couldn't have chose a better machine, it does everything I need it to. Coming from a 27" iMac and a MacBook Air, I am confident in saying this exceeds my expectations for a school computer.
