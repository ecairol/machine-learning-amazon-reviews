Will no longer purchase from Amazon.com
I purchased this computer and was really excited to recieve it. I played with this chromebook at Best Buy and loved it, but saw an amazing deal on Amazon so I figured it would be well worth the wait. Unfortunately when I recieved the package, I found my laptop to be in horrible condition. Before I even flipped the computer open I could see obvious scratches all over the top of the computer. After further investigation, I saw oily fingerprints on the mousepad, and scratches on the screen. When I logged onto the computer, I was asked to provide a "password." If this was a so-called "new" computer, why would I be asked to provide a password? There was a user account set up, with the previous owners name and personal email clearly shown. This lax treatment of personal information is unacceptable, and the quality of the product shipped to me is embarrassing. I plan to never purchase from Amazon again, and plan on warning all friends to proceed with caution.  The only positive experience I had was with a customer relations agent named "Vijay," who proved to be understanding and quite helpful.
