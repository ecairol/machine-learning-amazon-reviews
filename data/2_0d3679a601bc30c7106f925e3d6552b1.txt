Good Smart Set
I compared smart TVs around 40 inches and found the VIZIO models that were a tad older but decided to take a chance on this one. Came to me just fine; hooked up just fine; Amazon prime works like a charm on it. Setup takes a little while (I am not real quick at set up) but it went without a hitch. And, it hooked to a S3821 sound bar just fine also. It's a keeper. You can save a few bucks getting the older models, but when I see essentially the same model in appearance and design yet the details of the model number show that it's been modestly improved, then I figure they have added some tweaks to an already successful line. That appears to be the case. Usage: about 2 weeks.
