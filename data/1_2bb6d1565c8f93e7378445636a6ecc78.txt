Love it!
Works great! Love the functionality as a labtop and tablet. The "tent" mode is great for referencing recipes while cooking. I'm giving 4 instead of 5 because I find it switching between applications randomly. This may be a user error but I am rather computer savy and can't seem to figure out a method to the madness. Besides that it is very fast and has a beautiful display!
