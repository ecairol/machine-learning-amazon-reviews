This laptop is fine for those applications and basic websurfing
I wanted a laptop on a budget just for my university teaching needs (making Word Documents, PowerPoints, Excels, PDFs - Office is not included). This laptop is fine for those applications and basic websurfing. The speakers are fairly basic, so this is probably not the computer to buy if your main aim is streaming music or watching movies. The touchpad is a little "clunky" for my taste; I use a small external mouse with laptops  in any event. I appreciate the relatively large keyboard (with number pad) and screen size. I also found the track pad irritating until I disabled "pinch zoom." This is larger laptop, but is not too heavy. Battery life is great - though it is new. The power chord is a little short compared to most laptops. Overall, a solid laptop for its price.
