I'm yet disappointed with Amazon
I'm yet disappointed with Amazon.  My daughter has had this chromebook for just over a year and the keys are sticking BAD.  You had to hit the letter like 50 times to make it take the letter.  I did not expect this as I did not get a warranty so i would have to repurchase one and hope to get close to the same amount for the defective keyboard.  I was told to contact manfucturer and was not very happy about that.  I was then just CAUGHT off chat and he just LEFT THE CONVERSATION!  Really nice Amazon!!!!
