It is reasonably fast and looks pretty great for what I use it for
The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the light coming through the plastic shell behind the screen.  I ended up taking the entire 13 inch panel out and using reflective tape where the problem was.  If it came from the factory that way, it would be a 5 star.  It is reasonably fast and looks pretty great for what I use it for.
