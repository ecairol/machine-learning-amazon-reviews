Perfect combination of size, weight, and power for an on-the-go Linux machine.
I've only had it three days, but so far I love it. I wanted a powerful lightweight machine with a smaller screen for media viewing, web browsing, light gaming and light programming use and it fits the bill perfectly.I didn't even boot into Windows 10, I just backed the image up as a safeguard and installed Debian on it. I couldn't get the firmware for the wi-fi to load with the standard Debian install media, but using the unofficial media that includes non-free firmware it worked immediately.Once everything was installed it worked perfectly with the exception (as has been previously noted) of the backlight adjustment keys.Overall I am thrilled with the unit. It replaced an old netbook that was way too slow for what I needed it for. I am a computer tech and most of my machines are cobbled together Franken-boxes or old hand-me-downs. This was well worth what I paid for it.
