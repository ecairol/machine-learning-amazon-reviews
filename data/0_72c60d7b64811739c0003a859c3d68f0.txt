Disappointing
I guess I was just expecting something a little faster, more competent. Up swipes are confused as side swipes, sometimes you'll have to tap the same spot five or six times to get a response, even if the icon is highlighting every time you push, the function doesn't happen. You can't place your cursor into the middle of a paragraph you just wrote if you want to edit, this mostly occurs in aps but come on, I have to delete everything to where I want to edit. Often, the iPad will randomly open Facebook or Twitter, because it thinks I touched the tiny icon on the corner of a web page or ap, when my finger was on something an inch away. Just writing this review, it corrected finger to ginger and when I tried to move the cursor to the word to edit, it randomly pasted a website URL from my clipboard where I had touched. I then deleted the unwanted erroneous URL, tried again, and it pasted the URL a second time... Delete. Try again. Maybe this thing is good for games and kids, but don't try to do mobile business on it unless you have the patience of a monk.PeterIt's the little things that kill, two stars.
