It is ok - i bought a smaller one for my daughter - the 11 inch and it is a great machine - i feel like this one isn't of the same quality - it also has a problem of going into sleep mode and then not waking up without a hard reboot. I was expecting something of the quality of my daughters and this is not it. I wanted the bigger screen but would probably buy the smaller one for the quality. This one just feels a little cheap and not as solid.
