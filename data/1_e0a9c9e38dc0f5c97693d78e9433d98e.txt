Great for the price
Bought this at best buy a little while ago because it was significantly cheaper. I'd recommend looking around for the best price.Short story is that it's a great laptop. Touchscreen is super accurate and responsive. Keyboard has a very nice feel to it, seems to be Mac inspired. I bought it to do basic tasks like browsing Internet and word as a compliment to my other computer. I didn't try to run anything too extensive, but ran FTL well and appeared to be able to run MATLAB decently. Is very light and portable which was my primary concern. The Yoga feature is really cool. Battery life lasts beyond the 5 hours that some other are claiming.I really recommend it, quite pleased with my purchase.
