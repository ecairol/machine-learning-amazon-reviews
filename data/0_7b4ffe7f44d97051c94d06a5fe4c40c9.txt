Interesting idea, poor execution.
When you base a device on a single application (Chrome) that application better work damn well. I had three major issues within 10 minutes of taking my Chromebook out of the box.1. Froze during initial setup. Had to reboot to get past that problem.2. Won't play Netflix. Apparently this is a known bug. I wish I had known about it before I bought this. Chrome in Windows has no such problems.3. I need to enter a credit card number to play my own music that's stored on my own computer? BS!It goes back.
