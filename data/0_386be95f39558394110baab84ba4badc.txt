The low price does not forgive its suckiness
My brother in law gave me his new laptop to setup for him. After working on it for 5 minutes I commented to myself, "What a piece of s***". The processor is absolute garbage and is barely faster then a tablet CPU. Sure the low price is attractive but you truly get what you pay for. Just running a professional anti virus program slows(trend micro) slows  this thing to a crawl. My professional opinion is to pass this bargain by, save up another 100 dollars and by something with a multi core cpu. You will be much better served.
