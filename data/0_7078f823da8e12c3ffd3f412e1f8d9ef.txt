High reviews unwarranted - still in beta-testing!
Please read the dialog on this cmputer before spending $1500. I loved the computer when I bought for all the reasons stated-I got the i7 with 256 capacity- size, screen, style, weight, capability...but after installing security and basic software and using only abut five times the wireless/internet cards stopped working and the display started blacking out....something is really wrong with this computer. The Dell support was not helpful and after an hour (starting with having me try and test online when I had no internet access????) he said I needed to carve out 8hrs to schedule Dell support to come to my house and replace the hardware. No thanks... so disappointed.. I thought I had found my perfect computer...
