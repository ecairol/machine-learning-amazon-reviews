PLEASE only review your actual item and post it in the correct location (i.e. brand, model, year, etc).
for the money, vizio e-series tvs are the best bang for the buck. simple.  pull yourself back from the cliff, save your money, and simply buy the best bang for the buck.  you will  be happy you did.  (note:  unless you are a videophile or sitting close to the TV, UHD is a waste of money... at least for the next couple of years.  wait.)==========by the way=================================why are so many reviews on this site and for this tv for other model numbers--- or worse--- years?????  the critical reviews for this model (e70, 2015) are almost all from prior year and smaller (completely different components and tech).  Plus, many of the reviews are from out of warranty issues.  how can anyone be out of warranty... unless they chose (foolishly) not to buy an extended warranty.  these are tvs... they break... extended warranties get you a repair or new one.anyway, PLEASE only write reviews for the actual item you are reviewing.  otherwise, those of us trying to discern which brand, model, and year are forced to sift through your unrelated non-sense.  nobody has that kind of time.thank you.
