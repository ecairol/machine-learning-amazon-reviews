I choose this brand and model after seeing some good reviews.  It worked fine for about a month, then starting acting up to a point where it became totally unusable.  The keyboard would not type correctly and mouse issues.  Looking on Facebook, others have experienced the same problems.  ASUS customer service first told me that it was a Windows problem, but that made no sense as an external keyboard worked, just the keyboard in the PC would not.  I finally got them to admit the issue was with the PC itself and due to the newness, was assured that if I sent it in, they would make a note in my file to expedite the repair and likely turn it around in one day.  I sent it in and now there is no note in my file, they have had it for four working days and no idea when the repair will be finished, but told me likely 5-7 working days.  Bad enough that the quality stinks, but their customer service apparently straight out lied to me about expediting service. Terrible!
