I love my new Lenovo Yoga 2 11.6" TouchScreen 2-in-1 Laptop
I was looking for a new laptop to use in my real estate business and this laptop fit the bill. It's large enough to see the screen clearly and small enough to take with me while I'm showing houses to buyers. I take it to my office so there is no need for a big desktop computer although I do have the Lenovo 23" all in one at my home office. I've had this little work horse for 2 months now and am very please with the results so far.
