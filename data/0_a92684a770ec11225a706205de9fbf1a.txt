Crappy Computer-Save your money
The worst computer I have ever owned. It came pre-installed with a lot of crap already on it that slows down my computer. I can no longer switch back and forth between word and the internet just by minimizing, but have to completely switch screens. There is so much that I hate about this computer, and I would never in a million years recommend it to anyone.
