Ehhh... For the price, you can't complain.
Bought this for a friend who needed something for school.  For the price, you really can't complain.  It feels cheap since its plastic and does not have the nice glass monitor but it does what it's supposed to do.  It's fairly fast, no issues running Office or surfing the web.  Good for school and people who just need something cheap and reliable.
