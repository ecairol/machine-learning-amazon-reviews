A well built, well performing and portable laptop!
I Should start by saying that I had a HP laptop that was heavy and had the worst battery life. My needs were very specific : I needed a laptop that is extremely thin and light, that does not heat up to an uncomfortable level and that lasts me long. I was waiting for ASUS to release the LA version and bought it the day it was first made available.Everything about the laptop screams quality. The build quality is top notch and so is the battery life. The keyboard is decent, nothing to write home about and the trackpad is more than adequate for all the multi-touch and scrolling gestures one would typically need. However, on a dark, fully-black screen you can see light bleed from the edges. This is a very minor annoyance and would only matter only if you are looking for it and being nit-picky. More than satisfied with the purchase. If you guys have any questions, let me know and ill try my best to answer them since I have been using this machine for almost a month now.
