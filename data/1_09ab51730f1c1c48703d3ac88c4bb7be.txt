The computer works okay, I just thought it came with a disc drive since you sent me Windows 8.1.  I also appreciate the free upgrade to windows 10,  I would actually like to talk to someone that could handle me returning this laptop for one with a disk drive, please don't set anything up now, I need to speak to person, not recordings and prompts if that is possible my number is 561-932-2488 between noon and nine pm est..  Thank you for taking the time.Evelyn Anderson
