Solid for the price and only great for a quick fix as in college research and writing or a bit more if you are into putting some hardware or software upgrades into this beast.  Gaming is difficult unless you dig bottom of the barrel graphics abilities so maybe consider that when shopping around.  I will give it 2 star only for the fact that it is quite light and easy to take care of in terms of lugging power brick being as it is very small on this unit.
