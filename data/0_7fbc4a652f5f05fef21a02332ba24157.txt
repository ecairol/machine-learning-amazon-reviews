Don't use your money on this one.
Was a great little laptop...for 2 months. I was sitting on the couch when suddenly the screen started to flicker and go white. I've tried everything to fix it, but nothing works. At this point i cant even see whats on the screen. I was going to return/replace it, but guess what? Cant return it as of a few days ago! How wonderful.thanks for the warning Amazon.
