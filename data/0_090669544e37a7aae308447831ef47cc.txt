Dead on arrival.
Seemed to be dead on arrival.  It looked like everything was new in the package and sealed from ASUS.  However, it would not turn on.  I left it plugged in for several hours to try to charge it, but could not get it to turn on.  None of the lights turned on to indicate that it was charging or powered on.  Seemed completely dead.  Thanks to Amazon for a prompt refund and taking it back!  I don't think I want a replacement.  I think I'll go with another brand.
