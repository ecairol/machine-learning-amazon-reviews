Definitely not the best
My parents always warned me, saying "You get what you pay for."  They were absolutely correct, and this is exception.The X551MA is a decent computer if all you want to do is listen to music, stream online video (internet connection pending), and MAYBE talk on skype or IM.  Just don't expect to be able to do all of these things at once.Possibly the biggest hinderance this laptop has is its Operating System, Windows 8.1.  Sure, it's an improvement over Windows 8, but I was expecting my first Windows 8.1 experience to be a bit better than this was.  Perhaps when Win 10 hits it will speed up a bit, as I hope the OS will be less dependent on processor speed and RAM usage.  High hopes for the future I suppose.I can't really find anyting "nice" to say about this laptop, as it does not have a CD drive (which is mentioned in the product description, so I'm not giving a bad rating based on that), has a bit of a "fuzzy" camera built-in along side some equally-as-bad microphones.  The screen is bright and reproduces colors nicely, but I often find it hard to make out the edges of barriers inside the web pages and Apps I use.  Perhaps my opacity is to high/low for the brightness, but that's not too big of a deal to me.  The keyboard is a breeze to type with, but the track pad (who even uses those anymore) is God-awful. It feels flimsy to use and is a pain to get used to.  I finally just bought a a wireless mouse and threw the dongle for that in the 2.0 port.  Speaking of which, this computer comes standard with one USB 2.0 Port and one USB 3.0 Port.  Realizing that this was completely unrealistic for a person like myself, I bought a USB 3.0 Port Hub and now use that to plug all my peripherals into.  Good stuff.In all, the X551MA is not the best laptop in the grand forest that is Amazon, but it will get the job done... eventually... if you can install it on Win 8.1... and if your processor doesn't cap at 100% for twenty-seven seconds straight.
