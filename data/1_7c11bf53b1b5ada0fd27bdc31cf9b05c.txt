Great keyboard, great speakers
Great keyboard, great speakers, and legit 10 hour battery for a full day of work.  I'm a copywriter, and so keyboard is very important for speed, accuracy and comfort - - this one fits the bill.  The trade-off for these three features is an average screen with limited angular viewing.  The 4GB is essential:  I have Google All Access Music playing as I work, and I also move to email from time to time as I write, so the 4GB ram is essential.  And with that ram, it hums along smoothly.  I also get around the average screen by using Chromecast with my 42" HDTV.I like this laptop and recommend it.
