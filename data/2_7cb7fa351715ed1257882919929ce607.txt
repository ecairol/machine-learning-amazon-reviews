This laptop is surprisingly pleasant to use. The key board is almost perfect, it got good graphics and quite good sound.I initially thought the Intel celeron processor would be a problem but it turns out the PC works just fine. The battery life is around 5 hours but can be as low as 2:30 Hours with continuous use like watching Videos.Overall I'd say its a great buy and would highly recommend it.I was even able to play a few games like need for speed and Grand Theft Auto (Sanadreas)
