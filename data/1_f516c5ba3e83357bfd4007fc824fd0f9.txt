Good laptop, great value for the money
This laptop is a dream.  It is super light-weight, and thin, and a good value for this price point.  Shut-down and boot-up take 1-3 seconds and graphics on the screen are bright and crisp.  Keyboard is good and responsive.  Laptop is silent, no sound at all .  Multiple internet tabs are not a problem.  I use it to surf the web and for home admin work, and it works great for that.  I researched a lot of laptops and was looking for very low weight, portability, decent computing power and low price.  This laptop meets my requirements and I am happy that I purchased it.Drawbacks are that it shows fingerprints and sometimes heats up after long usage (3-4 hrs).  It comes pre-installed with Windows 8, which as mentioned boots, very quickly.  I have found that one update seemed to freeze the machine on boot-up.  After downloading the update, boot-up would show "Configuring Windows features, 100% complete" and continue showing this for 30+ minutes.  I used the link below to solve the problem, which seemed to appear on a lot of Asus Windows 8 laptops.  The update that seemed to cause the problem  was "Security Update for Windows 8 for x64-based".  I solved the problem by doing multiple hard reboots of the laptop.http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-system/asus-transformer-t100t-tabletlaptop-stuck-on/2a099e22-4edf-42fd-bfab-375161b6bd73Someone earlier commented that the delete and power buttons are close to each other and sometimes lead to the user turning off the laptop by accident.  I have noticed this key placement too, but so far it has not been a problem.All-in-all, I recommend this laptop.  If the laptop didn't show fingerprints, heat up, and didn't have that windows update glitch I would rate a 5.
