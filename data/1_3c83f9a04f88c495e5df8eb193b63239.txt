Deeply flawed, but serviceable
Deeply flawed.  Speakers are hardly audible, I've found this to be little more than a glorified web browser.  On a positive note, it has great battery life and is very fast.Wouldn't recommend this to others who want to store files (not google drive, but on the HD), customize settings, utilize folders.  It's best to save up and get a laptop with Windows/Linux.
