A bargain
This is a good but not outstanding laptop. Nice sharp screen, reasonably light, and decent battery life. Performance is adequate, about what is expected of the modest 2 GHz dual-core processor. Windows 8 could use more speed and better graphics hardware, but getting that extra power comes a fairly hefty extra cost that I was not willing to pay for only occasional use.  If this will be your only computer, consider spending an extra $100 or so to get a more powerful model. Since I primarily use my desktop machine plus tablet & phone, an expensive laptop was not in my plan.
