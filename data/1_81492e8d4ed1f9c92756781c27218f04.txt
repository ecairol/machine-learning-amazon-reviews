88% of the Dell for 60% of the price
My needs were for a travel PC with a 1080 screen.  My i7 laptop is nice, but is nice and heavy too.I was not looking forward to hauling it around.  The ASUS is a feather by comparison.With the Dell XPS-13 (2015) it was $100 to get an i5, $100 to get 8 Gb of RAM, $100 to get 256 Gb of storage.This is now $1099, $400 more than the ASUS.  Paying 40% more for 12 to 15% more speed was not the need.The Core M is not as fast as the i5 and has the 5300 graphics instead of 5500, but still does a good job for most business tasks.The lack of backlight on the keyboard is a drawback. If I lived on an airplane I would be tempted to find the $400 for the Dell.  If this was to be a primary PC then the decision would move to the Dell or a Lenovo X1 Thinkpad.For the type of use it will get, The ASUS was a bargain.Update:After traveling for two weeks with the UX305, it performed mainly as expected.The trackpad buttons are somewhat clunky, so I normally just tap the pad.  This usually works, but I find myself developing a habit of hammering the pad or double tapping, just to make sure the click works.There were times when a backlit keyboard were missed, but it was not a deal breaker.Video performance was consistent, as were individual office applications.  If this is all you need it will provide acceptable performance.The thin light form was a joy to travel with and the adapter worked fine on 120/240VMultitasking is not a strong suit and if some windows task is hungry it can bring the PC to its knees until it passes.Make sure you do your windows updates in advance as the PC will be in la la land for over half an hour with "Do not turn off your computer"The first observation still stands.  If this was to be my main PC it would be on the weak side, but for casual travel it met the need.
