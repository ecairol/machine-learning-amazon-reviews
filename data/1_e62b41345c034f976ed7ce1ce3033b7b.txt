I think for the price it's a fair value.  However, I wish I had paid more and bought a higher end product.  Insufficient instruction on basic navigation and utilization of the OS.  We had to send first one back as it would not turn off unless allowed to completely discharge the battery.  Return was flawless and quick.  Second one is without mechanical problems.
