Great little laptop that supports Linux, too
I initially purchased a Yoga 2 for a project that required the Windows operating system.  That project having concluded, and not having further use for Windows, I installed Linux Mint.  Works very well.In truth, I thought the Windows environment was a nice fit for this device's interesting melding of laptop+tablet capabilities.  However, my Yoga is not used for normal consumer-type tasks.
