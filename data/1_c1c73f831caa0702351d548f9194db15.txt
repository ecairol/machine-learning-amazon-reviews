Great performance but really loud fan
The performance of this machine is amazing.  It runs all of the Adobe Creative Cloud, Tableau, MS Office, and other high resource usage apps quite well.  I just can't get over a high pitched fan noise out of the box.  This might just be my product but I'm quite disappointed to end up with the bad apple.It's so loud that it sounds like a small server.
