ASUS does a great job at a low price!
This is a good PC for the price but don't expect too much with "Windows 8.1 with Bing"; I would say it has "Windows 8.1 with a Sling" and through research found out that most products that are cost effect and have Windows 8.1 - come with Bing tied into the operating system. Upgrades to a different operating system have to come from the manufacturer..... One structural design flaw - the touchpad is with out a left or right button, so to speak, and pressing this keypad requires too much to get it too work. I like ASUS though and their customer service is amongst the best. Great buy for a first time laptop!
