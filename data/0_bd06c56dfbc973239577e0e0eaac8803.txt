Just not up to par
Bought this to replace a Sony Vaio laptop running Windows 7.  It's been a big disappointment, every single operation on this brand new laptop with much better hardware is slower than it is on my older laptop.  Simple things like web browsing, MS office, etc just aren't up to par, this could be the increased demands of Windows 8, but you would think a brand new laptop would run these operations smoothly.As far as the design of the laptop, it's nice, compact and lightweight.  The touchpad overall falls short, it is integrated with the buttons so can be difficult to perform the correct click action and I do miss some of the iPad like controls that my touchpad on my old laptop had, which I thought were standard now, but I guess not.  I'm also not a fan of the Windows 8 UI, but that's not this laptop's fault.My recommendation is to look elsewhere, as you can probably get more bang for your buck.
