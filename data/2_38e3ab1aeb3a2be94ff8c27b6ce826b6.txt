Champ For Price
I bought this for work. I run large excel files, power points and so on. It boots up in seconds, every time. SECONDS. No noise, no hum, the only slowness I experience is on from the internet not keeping up. Aesthetically pleasing, but the FN shortcuts are different then older models. Once I had the muscle memory to use them though, it is very convenient.
