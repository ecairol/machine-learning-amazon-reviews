While performance wise this laptop is everything that it said it was, it is not black in color as it states. It says it is black on the product description on the box it came in, but after receiving two different ones, they are both a grayish, purple, brown color. Aesthetically it just is ugly to me. The picture on the description is black, the laptop pictured on the actual box is clearly black, but the laptop itself is not.
