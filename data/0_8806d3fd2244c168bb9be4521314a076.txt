waste of my money
I hate this laptop. It keeps freezing up when I try to activate Microsoft officeIt's not accepting the product key some numbers not working, shipping was also not on time, I  am definitely gonna return this junk. Should have both a diff brand instead. this laptop is not made by Toshiba its built in china i tried going on the Toshiba website just now and i am not able to do so as they dont recognise the serial # or product series. The website for this junk is start.Toshiba.com and not Toshiba.com. the mouse pad stop working and i am unable to download any driver from toshiba since this crap is not legit, i wont buy again on amazon prefer go in a store. I am so upset, i bought this because i was on a budget trying to study for the CPA exam and now i just waste my money, its now 3 months and i regret this so much, I cant even contact the seller which make this even worse.
