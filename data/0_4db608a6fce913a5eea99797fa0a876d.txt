Not worth it.
Totally engineered wrong. The power cable should be in the back. It's on the side and can easily be bumped and broken if you use this laptop on your lap. The USB ports are not very secure and wiggle around inside. The computer itself needed an update out of the box. Not that surprising but the update gets stuck in a loop. Like other reviews have also stated. I had to search the internet for a workaround, and update it manually to get past the loop. There is a memory leak somewhere and it eats up all the ram. This causes a delay when you type. 99% of the time when you start typing it will first display the second or third letter you've typed in a word before adding the first letter in after the other two are already inputted.  I wouldn't recommend this laptop. It's got some issues.
