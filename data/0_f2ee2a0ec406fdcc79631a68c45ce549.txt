It was good while it lasted.
UPDATE:The screen went black one day and will not come on.  Still works via HDMI.  It's only 3 months old and has rarely even left the house, so I would say it has little wear and tear.  Amazon return window has closed, so I guess I'll be contacting ASUS to see what can be done.  Really disappointed in the quality.Old Review:It's a great little notebook.  I bought it for my girlfriend, who doesn't really need anything beyond web content, video services (Netflix/Hulu), and document authoring (she already preferred G-docs).  She loves it.  It does everything she needs, has fantastic battery life, and a physical keyboard.  Only complaint is that the bluetooth seems to have issues.  It pairs and connects fine, but then after a while it drops the connection and we have a tough time getting it to re-connect.
