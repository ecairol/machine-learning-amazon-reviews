Waste of time
I've tried since January to get this working correctly.  I waited for the firmware update and nothing.  I give up.  I've have the Western Digital Box in my family room and it works as advertised.  I gave my parents a Roku and it works as advertised.  I have to keep re-programming it every couple of days.  Everything.  Date, time, wifi connection.  I don't even feel right placing it on e-bay.
