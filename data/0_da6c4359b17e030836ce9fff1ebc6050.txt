Too fragile for a school
It was great for about 2 months; however, I've learned that the screen is very fragile. I bought one of the hard cases that Amazon suggested (the iPearl), but it wasn't sturdy enough to protect my Chromebook. The screen cracked while the Chromebook, inside the suggested case, was in the padded laptop sleeve of my backpack. The backpack was in the car for our Thanksgiving trip. It wasn't under or sandwiched between anything.I'm a teacher and I know that many other teachers/Educational Technology instructors/schools are looking to Chromebooks as a way to get kids online cheaply. Your mileage may very, but I strongly suggest you invest in something stronger. I do think my problem was related to this model because I was LOVING the Chrome OS.
