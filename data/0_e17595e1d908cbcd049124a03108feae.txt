too many downsides
Some of these may be true of all chromebooks I don't know; if so consider them a critique of chromebooks in general, but there are a few things that drive me nuts about this product. 1) Biggest thing is that I was/am a dropbox user. If I want to save anything or edit anything in my dropbox from this chromebook, I need to pay for software for the priveldge. 2) It is very easy to accidentally close the browser. 3) Unlike a regular computer, correct me if I'm wrong, but you cannot restore your tabs. 4) There are a few other things that are not user-friendly, like no caps lock button. I know you can lock caps, I've done it by accident a few times, but there is no marked key for it. I haven't needed it badly enough to bother looking up what to press for it, but really shouldn't have to. 5) It's a little too light. It's hard to type on your lap because it wobbles around a lot. For these reasons I often choose to use another computer over this one, even for tasks it was designed for like webbrowsing.
