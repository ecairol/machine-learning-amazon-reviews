Terrible, do not waste you time.
Terrible!!!One Cornell University PhD candidate and a PhD physicist at Cornell could not figure out how to find the wi-fi  on the machine. Somehow it could not find available signals and going into various menus did not solve the problem. There is a video describing the exact scenario on youtube. Total waste of time and do not be lured by the low price. At least a thank you to Amazon for no hassle free return. Buy a Dell or a Mac.
