Slow Processor
Capacity is ok, and the RAM works pretty well, but the processor is SLOW!!! Running more than one application at a time taxes out the processor almost immediately. I rated it 2 stars instead of 1 for the simple fact that we got a huge discount on it during the Amazon Prime day. I would NOT recommend this for anyone. You might have to pay a little more, but you will actually get a functional computer.
