A fresh new experience without the constant ads and updates of Windows, reasonably priced.
If you're a Chromebook user already, want to learn a new way of doing things, or have some other special reason for getting one of these, do so.  It runs the Chrome OS (same guys who gave us Google Chrome) so it's very, very focused on those products.  There's even a whole new universe of programs to try.I, for one, like the simplicity and not giving my money to M$oft for once, and like the 11-inch form factor.But if you're used to Windows, the prices have pretty much evened out so think carefully since this is quite a different experience.(This written by someone whose computer experience goes back to TRS-80s.)
