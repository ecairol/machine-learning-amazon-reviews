it just wasn't very fun to use for me
This laptop performs. Make no mistake. But all the smaller things made me want to return it. There was no keyboard backlighting, the screen had noticeable backlight bleed and needed to be at 100% brightness in order to not squint, there were a couple resolution issues, the back of the top part lifts the bottom off the surface, the bottom got incredibly hot despite not really being a desk laptop, and overall, it just wasn't very fun to use for me.But in terms of what it could do, it was pretty much unbeatable at this price point. So, if you're more concerned with the mechanics of the laptop as opposed to the feel of it, this is the one for you. But, if you're like me and you prefer comfort over performance, look elsewhere.
