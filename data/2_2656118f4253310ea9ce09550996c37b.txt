Not purple like everyone said, great laptop
It's a great laptop. Only took 5 days to get here and I ordered on a Friday. Was surprised to notice that it wasn't a "plum"/"dark purple" sort of color everyone has been saying that it comes in instead of black...? I was actually kind of hoping it would come in that color, but no big deal, got Obsidian Black like it said i would.A little bit of a fault on my part but when i ordered it, i didn't even notice that it didnt come with a cd player! I even watched like 6 unboxing/review videos on YouTube.A great buy i think, i would definitely recommend this laptop for anyone in college or high school or just looking for an easy and great laptop.Don't worry, you won't regret it.UPDATE: I have had this computer for 5 days now and it is just acting weird. From day one it was doing this... (the two photos) where the icon for something would be slightly covering the word when you right click something such a iTunes. That was annoying, it still hasn't changed. Other stuff has been happening and it has been stressing me out, just small stuff though. I have to say i am a bit disappointed. I had high hopes for this computer when i bought it.It will be a good college computer, typing papers and such. I just wish it would perform correctly.
