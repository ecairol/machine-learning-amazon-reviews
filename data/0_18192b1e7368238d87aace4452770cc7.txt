May be good for a college student, but no good for dads and granddads.
Too tiny. The text is too tiny and the graphics card doesn't allow you to adjust it to something bigger. The keyboard is not back-lit. After about 90 days of use, I've gotta return it to the factory now due to power/shutdown/restore problems (and I hear now that that's a common problem with this brand). If you're age 50 or older, find another laptop or tablet. You won't be able to use this one easily.
