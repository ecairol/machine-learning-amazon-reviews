Seems to me to be the best tablet out there (but you've got to be willing to pay a premium for it)
Some of these reviews from people who have supposedly purchased or used this device are a bit bogus (comments that don't match with the reality that actual device owners are experiencing).  Let's hope that those who are coming here for 'guidance' are also reading professional reviews from trusted media sources .. and .. talking to actual users of the product.My review: After trying several of the latest high resolution tablets on the market I returned all but one, the iPad Air. I can't find a thing about it to complain about (except the price). It's just outstanding in every way (display, size, weight, available apps, and operating system). It also addressed certain niggling complaints I had with my earlier iPads. With regard to other devices I tried, the latest Kindle Fires were excellent (great displays - and the price was right) but not sufficiently versatile to meet all my needs. The LG 8.3 was another excellent Android tablet but it didn't seem like a truly finished product (couldn't, for instance, lock it in landscape mode - very frustrating when trying to use it while lying in bed). It also seemed a bit pricy for what it was at nearly the price of an iPad Mini Retina (a tablet I was seriously considering for its portability). For what it's worth, the only tablets I tried, or even wanted to try, were those with very high pixel density displays. Later I also ruled out the true 7 inch devices with their 22 square inch displays (the iPad Mini's is 30 square inches, the LG 8.3's is 31, while the iPad Air's is 45). In other words, most of what else was out there had screens that were either too small or displays that were not sufficiently retina like.
