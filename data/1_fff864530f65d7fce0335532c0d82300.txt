Good but not perfect
This is a good product for a person who has knowledge about technology and is open to play around with it finding apps and making adjustments.  It is not something that will work out of the box without issues.Pros:- Support for Netflix, Amazon, etc.- Keyboard integrated with the remote- A lot apps available- Quiet device. I bought it to replace a PC I had connected to my TV (Samsung 42") that was making too much noiseCons:- Weak WiFi reception, this device connects and losses connection repeatedly, other devices in the same location (Wii, Android Tablet, Smart TV, iPod) work without issues. I had to install a router configured as repeater (using DD-WRT) and connect it via cable.- A standalone solution similar to XBMC is not available, if you want to have your movies library with movie details and front covers, Plex is an option, but you need a PC in the LAN and Plex doesn't support all video formats and subs.- Remote is not intuitive and doesn't have a backlight- Some applications still have issues, i.e. Netflix has problems with the language/Subs selection- The device has problems after being powered off and back on.  LAN connection is lost and it takes a while to be restored.  This is not about my setup with the repeater.
