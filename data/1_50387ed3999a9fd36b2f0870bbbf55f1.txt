Wicked awesome Laptop for personal and business needs!
Yes, this laptop is awesome! I'm very happy with it! It's good for basic needs, and even can play some computer games like the sims 3 pretty well. Battery life last about 4 to 4 1/2 hours which is good. It turns into a tablet but even better it can be set to any angle on top of that. I didn't think touch screen would really be needed but it makes the windows 8 experience so much more worth it. Keyboard does take a little bit to get used to and at times the laptop isn't super duper fast as you would find on others but for how small and the price it's well worth it and I'm happy with it!
