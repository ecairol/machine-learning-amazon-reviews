Keyboard is not back-lit, and some keys are larger which makes it easy to get thrown off. Stopped loading pages after a few days. Constantly needed a restart. Would have been a good product if not for those two major issues. Its a web based OS if it doesn't load you just have a piece of very well crafted plastic.
