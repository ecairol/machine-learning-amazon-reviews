Big things from a Little package
I picked up this laptop for college and LOVE it.I have had the laptop for 2 weeks.  Within 20 minutes of taking the laptop out of the box, I started the process of upgrading to Windows 10.  I use OneNote for note taking for class.  My old laptop weighed 7 lbs and the battery lasted a paltry 30 minutes.  This laptop is very light weight and the battery last all day for classes.  The virtual desktops for windows 10 is VERY helpful given the screen size.  I can quickly multitask between class and personal desktops (when I get a few extra minutes before class starts).When deciding on this laptop weight, battery life, and price were my leading factors.  I am super pleased with the purchase and have talked about it with classmates that are also going asus.  Buy with confidence.  I went with the Core M series and am glad I did not pick up the i5.  After researching both, I liked the longer battery life on the Core M.  This laptop is not a touchscreen, which I wont miss the fingerprints.  The screen is matte, so direct lighting from the rear isn't an issue.  Solid little laptop.
