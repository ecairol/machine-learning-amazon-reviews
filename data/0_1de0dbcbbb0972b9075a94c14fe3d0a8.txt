... this laptop thinking I was going to get a good product.
bought this laptop thinking I was going to get a good product....I have had it a few months and I still can't get my flashplayer to work on it. I have called and all they want to do is sell me more warranty so they can "fix" the problem. Will never buy another Lenovo product. I have a year warranty as it is but was told it doesn't cover software issues
