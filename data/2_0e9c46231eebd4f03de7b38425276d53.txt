Works awesome, like a 1/2 price MacBook Air
Works awesome, like a 1/2 price MacBook Air. Note that ConsumerReports thinks ASUS reliability is poor enough for them not to recommend it. After 4 months, I've had no problems. I'm basically using it as a dumb terminal (via TeamViewer) to be able to wander around work and operate my desktop machine. So I can't comment on the processor performance. Screen is nice. I do get 8+ hours of battery time usually.
