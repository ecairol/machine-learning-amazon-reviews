First class machine - excellent screen; nice keyboard
I am using the ASUS to create this review. First class machine - excellent screen; nice keyboard; fast enough for anything you probably need it for and wonderfully slim. Only upgrade I would like would be a back lit keyboard.1/2 the price of an equivalent MacBook.
