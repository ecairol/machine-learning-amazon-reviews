Light, functional, and cheap.
Nice product for the price. Arrived sooner than the estimated arrival time, and so far it performs smoothly. Haven't tested it out with any heavy gaming but it does seem to run them at a decent pace, as World of Warcraft ran at a steady 20+ frames on high settings.My only quarrel with the product is that the mouse-pad could have been a little better made, as I find it a little difficult to use the left and right click buttons, and often when I try to click it will also cause the mouse to move. Other than that.. I like it.Update: It can handle gaming.. Just not too well. Minecraft single-player is impossible to play, as the processor lacks the sufficient power required to handle things like world generation, and Mob movement. But it just barely meets the requirements to play games such as Borderlands 2, and Skyrim. If you're looking for a laptop for intensive gaming, you may want to look elsewhere.
