Great Idea---Poor design for remote!
It was toss up between the Apple TV and Google TV. My husband and I decided to purchase the Google TV box with that cool remote and keypad (even though my husband is a surf maniac--I did hesitate cause I read you can surf on the TV-which meant even more surfing and less time with the wife). Set up was easy except we have a Flat Screen TV with a HD cable card and the unit could not read the cable card for onscreen tv guide and live TV---so unfortunately this product would not work for us. Also, the remote was a great idea but poor design. The mousse pad on the remote was not working right in conjunction with the arrow on tv to click on links while surfing--it made my husband so frustrated he did not want this unit at all! We decided to return this item the next day and decided to wait for a better product or upgrade to a SMART TV---( I can't wait till internet streaming gets perfected for more channels for live TV so we can finally say good-bye to cable!!!)
