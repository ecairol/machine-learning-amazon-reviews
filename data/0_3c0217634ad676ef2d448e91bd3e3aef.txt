Not Durable
The performance of this tablet is absolutely spectacular.  The problem is durability.  We bought two.  The screen on one cracked without being dropped or anything.  We called Apple and they were kind enough to replace it for free.  The replacement lasted about a week and it cracked when we dropped it from 12 inches onto a cushioned ottoman.  This is nuts for a $700 tablet.  Prior to this we had two iPad 2s for several years with no issues.  Although our nearest Apple store is 200 miles away we are going to ride over there and show it to them.  I'll update this review with the results.Meanwhile, we have bought two Otterbox Defender cases for them and are just hoping to get by with no more cracks until we can get better tablets.
