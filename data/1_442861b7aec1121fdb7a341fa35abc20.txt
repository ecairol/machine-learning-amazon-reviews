I am like many people here who bought this machine
I am like many people here who bought this machine. I did as much research as everyone else. I came to the conclusion everyone else did as well. For the price, this machine is an exceptional buy. In fact when I received my Zenbook from ASUS.....it was far nicer than I expected, particularly at this price point. This is a solid, very thin and well made 13 incher. It is actually so cool, I always take it with me in case I need it, so people can see it...It is very much a quality statement. Anyway, this aesthetics stuff isn't even the best thing about this laptop. The best thing about it is its speed. It literally takes less that three seconds from pushing the power button to being completely on. NO WAIT AT ALL. I've had this thing for 4 months and it is actually the best computer I have ever had. It is as fast as I always thought a  computer should be.  It came with Win8.1 and I upgraded it to 10 out of the box. If there were anything I would change about this computer is to make an addition. I would add back lighting to the keyboard......Other than that.....well you really can't beat it....not even apple is as thin or fast  or inexpensive.....699.00 most places
