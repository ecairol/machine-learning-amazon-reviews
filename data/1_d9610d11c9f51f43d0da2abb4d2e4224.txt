Daughter's Christmas & Birthday Present +
1st off - better prices are available now (figures!) @ other stores. That being said, my daughter loves it! She and my son-in-law love the Retina display, the overall speed and capability of the Air. She uses it both @ home and work. I'm writing this on a Windows PC and I'm already saving up so that when this dies I can move on up to Apple!When I plugged her Air into my wall for the initial charge (12 hrs. one time only), it immediately recognized my Wifi net as well as those of my closest neighbors! If you use a Windows PC then you know the hoops you go thru sometimes to establish and connect to your own net! This Air handles the data processing my "kids" need at work in the airline industry without any difficulty at all and whisks through various cloud (Google or Apple) services.
