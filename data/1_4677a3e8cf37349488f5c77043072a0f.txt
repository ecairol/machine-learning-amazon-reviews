Decent, but low in quality.
Decent and compact device... but has one flaw... screws underneath are falling out - constantly! Laptop has never been opened or tampered with. In the end all screws I had to replace since it almost break apart. Tip when want to buy ASUS laptop - resist the price and speck's and just buy some quality brand for little bit more money.
