Would have been nice if company actually cared to stand behind it.
While this is an ok device. Be aware that the manufacturer abandoned the device before it was 6 months old and if any reviews and posts from any of their social media presences are any indication (as well as my own experience) DO NOT expect any sort of service or support.This was my first and last time ever dealing with products from this manufacturer. This is a shame as the product does have the potential if the company actually stood behind it.One of the issues other then fixing features that never worked or updating the OS to current is the fact the Netflix App is baked in and never updates to latest version. Even the Revue (also a product I own) has an newer Netflix app with profiles.
