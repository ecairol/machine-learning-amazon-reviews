Perfection
I had the retina mini which was great but too small for web browsing comfortably for extended periods.  I exchanged it for the Air.I'm much happier with the Air.  The extra screen space is more than worth it to me.  No more panning and scrolling and zooming endlessly with the mini, that is over with the Air.  The Air also plays video and music beautifully.  I actually felt the mini was absolutely perfect form factor for tv, movies, and e books.  The Air does all these things great too, but mini did them better, in my view.  Sigh.....so long, little dude.I had an ipad 4 from feb to yesterday.  Ten months.  It was great.  I sold it easily on Craig's list for $320.  I wish I priced it higher.  I could have likely gotten $350 for it.  In any event, I paid $180 to use it for ten months or eighteen dollars a month.  Fifty cents per day.  I can live with that.Love my new ipad Air.  It is sleek, light and attractive.  Easy to hold with one hand and I have small hands.  I have known girls shorter than me who had bigger hands than me.I recommend the Air.  A superb investment.  Whatever ur needs.  If you read. Or watch tv and movies, or need a great camera, organizer, music player.  It is a great product.  Just go get it.  Sell other stuff if u have to.  You will not regret.
