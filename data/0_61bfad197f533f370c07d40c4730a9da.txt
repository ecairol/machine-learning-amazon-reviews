Good price with the features
Good price with the features, but the quality is not very good. Laptop freezes often in the middle of the application running. It doesn't come with window 8.1 manual/instructions for learning purpose. I am going to try out for 1 more week, if I still encounter additional problems, I will return it to Amazon.com and will get a refund.
