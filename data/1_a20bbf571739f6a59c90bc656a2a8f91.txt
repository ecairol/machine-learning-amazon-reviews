As a Laptop Replacement, No Real Downsides So Far
I'm a grad student and when my laptop went on the fritz, this was my replacement.Pros - The Apple App Store is easier to navigate and more trustworthy in my opinion than the Android app store.- like my iPhone, the interface is clean and much less cluttered than my Samsung tablet- the onscreen keyboard is very useable- there are a lot of available accessories, as should be expected- this seemed like less of a toy to me than a Kindle Fire- free iWork apps- so lightweight- great battery life- the screen is beautiful- I can download all my docs from DropboxCons- the external button to put it to sleep is small- it may just be the screen protector I purchased (Tech Armor clear), but the distance between the home button and the edge of the bezel is small and the screen protector will not seal there- no fingerprint scanner like the iPhone 5s- there is currently not a flawless PDF app for iPad, so using Adobe reader on my laptop was a better experience
