Well Worth The Money
Bought this computer about 2 weeks ago and so far it has done very well for what it costs well worth the money. This is the first time I played with windows 8 and it has been a bit of a learning curve since I am used to windows 7 professional. For the money it cant be beat battery lasts a long time been watching Netflix youtube ect with no problems at all even playing simcity and it seems to be doing ok.The wireless system in it works VERY well picks up about anything thats within reasonable reach better than my previous laptops keyboard is fine and it's very light weight. The only things I wish it has would be another usb port 2 more would be great it only has 2 of them. The processor is up to everyday tasks I have ran it with up to 4 windows open at the same time seems to keep up anything more than that gets a little sluggish.If your looking for a lower priced laptop that can actually do as advertisied this is it cant beat the price and it does a good job If this one got destroyed or stolen I would but another one without thinking twice about it.
