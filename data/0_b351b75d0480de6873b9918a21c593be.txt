Terrible!
This has turned out to be a terrible laptop. We have had nothing but problems since we purchased it in Sept. '14. To name a few, the battery won't hold a charge, the track pad doesn't work correctly and the screen brightness didn't work. Within the first 3 months, we had to call tech support and they had to reload software and make other adjustments that did not fix the battery drain issue. After charging overnight, my child will turn it on only to find that it didn't charge or he'll get to class with what appears to be a full charge and within a minute it will drop to zero. We have called tech support numerous times and the only solution now is to create a service order and send in the laptop for repair. While they say they will go as far as rebuilding the laptop (replace the motherboard, etc) this option is not feasible until school ends as my middle school child is required to have a laptop at school. At least it will still be under warranty at the end of the school year but I can't tell you what a hassle it's been to deal with this and if the warranty expiration date was during the school year, we would have no choice but to send it off and leave my child without a laptop.  His classmates with the same Lenovo are also unhappy with their choice as well. This should have been a great option for a first laptop for a 6th grader and we regret not spending more for a more reliable product. Lenovo also had an incorrect warranty expiration date so I had to email our Amazon purchase receipt--another hassle. Nothing but problems and disappointment.
