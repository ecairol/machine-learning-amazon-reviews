Please fix glitches if you are going to continue selling or at least be honest about problems. or did i just get a dud?
I am sorry for having to post a bad review, but this thing does nothing that you guys said it would. if I click on another tab to open then the first tab totally shuts down or freezes up or stop then starts back up. I have down loaded NOTHING on here just did what yall said to use it for surfing and for streaming. It is horrible. It has a VERY low volume. I have to hook it up to speakers to hear it. I hooked it up to my tv hoping that I could hear it better and for 2 days it did fine then the volume started going up and down up and down. I switched out with my old lap top to make sure it wasn't a tv issue and it workd fine. This the the worst product I have ever purchased like this. Next time I will go with my gut and stick with hp. The sad thing is I love google chrome. but it does not help this product at all and to top it all off it is not user freiendly. I would have contacted the seller directly instead of leaving a bad review, but it has not given me the option to do that!
