Great PC for the Money!
UX305LA Core i5 September 2015 US Release Win 10 Pre-InstalledI Pre-Ordered and Received from Amazon on September 15th.For the money (half of a Macbook Air) it is a very nice option.I got this for my daughter and I am very pleased with the size and performance. I have reset this thing about twice now (my fault as I messed around with the settings and erased things I shouldn't have) Very easy to start from scratch with Win 10.The Asus Bloatware is not that bad. I would say about 5 or so programs you need to un-install.With the SSD drive it has a lightning startup. Ultra Thin package and feels very sturdy.Battery life depends on brightness level. If you have power savings mode on, it will adjust your brightness to get the full 12 hours it advertises.If you mess with the brightness at all, it will adjust the battery life. With a full charge and 100% brightness you will get about 3 hours. (have not tested this much yet)All in all, definitely not up to par with a Macbook, but a very nice second place and excellent for Students or for something light on the go.My kids play with with Online Minecraft Servers, watch YouTube religiously and log onto Comcast On-Demand all the time. It handles it all like a champ so far.I did get a wireless mouse and additional keyboard as this is on a stand.The trackpad is clumsy, but hopefully future hardware updates fix this.The Microsoft Edge Browser is actually not that bad. I'm a Firefox user, but will give the Edge a few weeks to see what it can do.My kids don't mind what browser they use as long as they can play their online games.4 Stars as it is a very nice package, but as I said, definitely not a Macbook.However, for the money the UX305LA cant be beat.
