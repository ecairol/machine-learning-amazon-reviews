Great Chromebook for the price, but made cheaply.
I have had this chromebook for about 2 months and I have had only one issue, one which I should have dealt with earlier.  Out of the box the down arrow key was popped off the keyboard, and I could not jury rig it to stay on.  I have build many PCs and have had a good number of laptops that had keys pop off but usually I could fix the issue, but with this Chromebook, I just cant get it to stay on.  It is most likely a fluke, but it is a bother.The entire machine feels cheaply built but for the price it is worth it.As for the actually important stuff, the ASUS C201 runs exceptionally smooth, is very responsive, and has an insanely long battery life (10-12 hours).  I just use it to surf the internet on my couch but I highly recommend it as an alternative to a netbook.  Also, while in sleep mode it uses almost no battery life.TLDR: I got one with a broken key, cause it seems a little flimsy, but this Chromebook is quick, responsive and has a great battery life.
