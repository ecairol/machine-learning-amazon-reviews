Nice lightweight and good battery life. VLC app doesn't work on Chrome.
I do like the Chromebook and I would love it if you could get the VLC app for it! Chromebooks do not play DVD's even if you have an external DVD drive. It will play other formats but you have to rip every DVD into that format and that takes a long time. VLC app which plays any format is suppose to be available this year, hopefully. I would not buy another Chromebook until this happens. But if you don't care about DVD playing then it is a nice laptop. The battery life is wonderful and you can get almost a full day of using it. Growing up with Windows it did take a bit to learn the Chrome way of doing things but one you learn it is fine. Also, I got the Chromebook so I could watch free movies while I fly. I thought Delta Studio worked on Chromebooks but it does not work on this one. You can use a NTFS external hard drive with this Chromebook so storage is not a problem. The Chromebook is lightweight and would be great for a college kid to take to classes to be able to take notes and surf the web.
