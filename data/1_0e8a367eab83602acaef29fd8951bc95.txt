Lots of Technical Positives For End Users In A Lightweight Package
This is my first netbook, I'm reasonably impressed by it's glare free screen, sensitive touch pad, fast response time, 3.0 USB and long battery life. The pre-loaded Windows 10 is so much easier to use than Windows 8.X, but on my important work tasks I still resort to my laptop with Windows 7 Pro. I'm getting used to "the cloud" and not having all those extra slots for CD-RW  etc and actual restore disks or other restore media.Nice and lightweight for this noob to the cloud.UPDATE 10/17/2015:  It runs a little hot and will lock up after lengthy usage. If you plan using it a few hours at a clip you need a chill-mat or something to keep the vents clear. I don't recall hearing a fan kick on.
