This is a budget laptop (at $249 when I purchased) and it is most evident in the mouse pad and responsiveness when scrolling. The mouse pad is "stiff" and makes clicking on, for instance, a tile in a Scrabble game, more laborious than it should be. I have mainly owned Dell laptops in the past and have never experienced such an awkward mouse pad that requires a lot of pressure to click and move a cursor or object. A wireless mouse may be the answer to this dilemma. When scrolling using the mouse pad on the side bar, it is often slow. The screen is bright and clear and the keyboard is comfortable while including a numeric keypad on the right side which is quite convenient when keying numbers in spreadsheets. Overall this will be fine for my kids to use to work on homework and research topics for school, however, if you're accustomed to a Dell and don't mind putting another $50 toward a laptop I would recommend doing so.
