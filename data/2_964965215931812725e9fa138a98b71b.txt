Very nice laptop for the money!
Great, lightweight laptop for the money! So far, no problems. It's not the fastest processor going, but suits my home, casual gaming, and lightweight business use just fine. The keys are fairly flat and have a nice spring return to them. Took a little getting used to them as their markings (especially symbols) are on the small side and are a lightweight font. They look like decals, too, so time will tell at how well they'll hold up. I wish it had at least one more USB port as I use a wireless mouse and a camera cable and flash drive to upload photos so can't do that now without a splitter. The laptop body itself has a nice low profile and it doesn't get hot, so no need for a cooling mat or some such. It keeps a charge pretty close to what the specs say if you're not doing high-pixel and processing tasks. I ordered mine with an optical drive as I have DVDs for activities that aren't available on the web and I also use this as a portable TV sometimes. It also would have been nice to have the option of bundling programs into it as the manufacturer can get a better deal on programs than us single-purchase schmucks. I miss my Office programs and am using the Online Office freebie which is a bit of a pain, but it's adequate for now.
