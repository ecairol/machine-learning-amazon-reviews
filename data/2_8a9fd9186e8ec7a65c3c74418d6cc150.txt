Purchases this item as a Christmas present.  Overall the device works great. No problems or issues with how it runs or operates.  I did find that the shell or the housing of the laptop seems cheaply made and manufactured. If it would be used to go back and forth from site to site or from someone that uses this on the go, I would recommend something a little more durable.  Yet if you plan on using this only at home or if you are going to leave it on a desk and no where else, This item would work great.  I like said I purchased this item for a Christmas present and didn't want to have a lot of money into it.  For the price I paid and looking at how to preformed and not the outside was manufactured, this is a great item.
