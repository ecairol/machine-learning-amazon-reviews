Excellent device with one caveat
For the price-point, I would give this unit 5 stars if it wasn't for one thing--a glitchy mouse pad.  I've encountered two main problems with it.  The first problem is that all too frequently it takes a "time-out" break of 3 to 5 seconds (sometimes longer), leaving me wondering if I didn't tap the pad hard enough, or if I didn't tap the right portion of the pad, or if the system has locked up.  The second problem is that sometimes it just quits controlling the cursor altogether--the only way to get the cursor back is to do a left or right click on the pad.For me, this would be a show-stopper and I would return the device, but I picked it up as an "occasional use" device for my wife and she has opted to live with it because she is otherwise satisfied with the device and doesn't want to go to a higher price-point in light of how often she expects to use it.The over-all build quality and screen quality are fine and I'm hoping this is just a software issue that Lenovo can/will fix with an update, but unless/until that happens, I would only recommend the unit to someone who has the patience of a cat waiting for a mouse.
