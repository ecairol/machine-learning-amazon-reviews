So far so Good
I'm loving my chrome book so far.  The color is beautiful and it's so lightweight I don't have any problem carrying it around.  It also gets the job done. The only issue I've had is that the mouse pad buttons are a bit unresponsive when clicked. I find myself clicking it several times before it registers that I've selected something.
