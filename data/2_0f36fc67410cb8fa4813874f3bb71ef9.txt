Incredible
The product is incredible, good value for the money, perfect build quality, awesome display and battery life.Awesome job by Asus.With occasional failure of display driver, the product is unmatched by any laptops in this price range. I think it's one of the best out if not the best.Actually I'm quite fascinated why there are not much video reviews of this product ? It is certainly in the top 3, in my estimation .
