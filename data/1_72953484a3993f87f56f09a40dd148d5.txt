Solid product for the price.
This is a great laptop for the price. At first I wasn't sure if laptop without a fan would be powerful enough for my daily routine but this machine has handled everything I've thrown at it so far. The screen is a terrific display, and being matte is another plus in my book. The standard 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD (partitioned as two 128GB drives out of the box) is another huge benefit at the price point. I'll also say that not including a touchscreen or fingerprint scanners are positives in my book.I only have two minor complaints that keep this from being a full 5 out of 5. First, and this is the biggest point for me is the charging cable. Yes, the battery life on this laptop is great, but you will need to charge the laptop sometime. The charging cable is a wall wart, a huge negative. The cable is also very short. Ideally in the next revision of the laptop the cord will have a longer length with the power brick in the middle of the cord (like a MacBook Air)The other minor complaint is the packaged in bloatware. The ASUS software is mostly harmless and easily removed, but the inclusion of McAfee for an antivirus solution required much more time to fully remove and clean. I'm not a huge Windows 8 fan, but there are programs and tweaks you can install to remove most of the Metro interface.I wish I could give the product a 4.5 out of 5, because in my mind that is truly what it deserves. If ASUS can fix the charging cable, make McAfee optional, and include a Wireless AC card they have a winning product.
