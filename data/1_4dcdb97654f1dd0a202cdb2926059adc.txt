The fastest and thinnest tablet around
A anniversary gift for my wife and she loves it. The 32 GB was the right size as she takes lots of pictures,  downloads aps and watches movies and the video quality is excellent. I'm glad I went with the iPad Air as it works great with her iPhone. So far its worked flawlessly.
