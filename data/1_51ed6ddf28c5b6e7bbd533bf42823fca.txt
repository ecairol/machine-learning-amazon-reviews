Best work and play toy ever!
I purchase my unit from Microsoft Store $100 off no bloat ware on sale.I love this unit! I originally wanted the 303la but the hinge issue stuck in my mind so I did not purchase it..Best money I ever spent, It will eat up your time at play, currently it runs Windows 10, Gnome Ubuntu 15.04and yes Yosemite. In fact as I type I am on Yosemite.Buy it you will not regret it. ( caveat the touchpad  takes some tuning )
