good bang for buck
good value for money few flaws, battery life sucks, dont care for win 8 but if you want win7 feel install classic shell and you will be back to 7,more ram would be nice but you get what you pay for,optical drive would be nice or more usb ports.overall happy with it but since im running linux it flyes and is great for what i do.
