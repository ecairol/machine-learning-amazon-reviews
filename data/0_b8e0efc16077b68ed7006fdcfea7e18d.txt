Worse Purchase Ever, not a quality build.
Avoid this product!After less than 3 months of use the screen has gone faulty.  The left side has a black area.  Contacted support and sent photos, Toshiba claims not covered under warranty.  Sent photos showing no miss use, yet not covered.  We have had a Samsung Chromebook for over two years that I will admit has been heavily used as a school laptop still going strong.If after normal use at home this happens, I question the manufacture of this product.  I would recommend any other company for Chromebook as taking to school each day this would not handle that abuse.  It can't handle being on a counter for 3 months with normal light use.Please save you money and choose another brand.UPDATE 7/16/15I decided to try and repair the screen myself considering that Toshiba would not repair under warranty.  After removing the screen bezel held in place with two screws I was able to remove the fauly LCD.  What I was surprised to see is that unlike other replacement screens and also videos posted, this LCD had no tabs to mount it to the frame.  There are four holes to attach the LCD screen to the case and yet it was not fastened.  It seems like it was held in place by some sticky tape or bonding that came away with little effort.  I am now able to order a new screen for $60 and have a funtioning Chromebook.  I question not only the quality of the part but the build.
