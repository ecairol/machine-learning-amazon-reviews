A REALLY GOOD TELEVISION AT ANY PRICE - A SENSATIONAL TELEVISION AT THE AMAZON PRICE
I've spent forty years of my life as a writer-producer-director and documentary filmmaker. I've looked at every kind of critical monitor that's been used since the late 70's. Properly tweaked, this television performs as well as any Mitsubishi (2K). If you set it correctly the blacks are very black (all the way down to -6 on a scope). There are plenty of preset adjustments for color, I prefer vivid myself, but there really an acceptable look for everyone. So I ask you, why spend $100 more for a Mitsubishi? Please don't go by the way the televisions look in the store. It is a common practice to tweak up expensive sets and tweak down inexpensive ones. Beyond the picture, this smart TV gives you Amazon (and a zillion movies), Netflix, and YouTube, plus a bunch of others I never watch. YouTube has become my favorite channel. If you like old TV, especially the 50's there are some outstanding shows that have unfortunately been forgotten. Indeed, there's an episode of Medic about the role of a doctor in a nuclear war that is probably one of the best shows ever made. If memory serves it won five or six emmys.
