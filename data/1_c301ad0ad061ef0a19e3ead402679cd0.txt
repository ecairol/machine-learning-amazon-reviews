Best student laptop for the price.
Pros: Does the job, seems very capable and probably the best student laptop i could have for the price. No issues software wise yet, still setting it up though. very light weight (maybe to light, read cons). keyboard is quick and has a good tactile feel to it.Cons: everything is plastic and feels like they shaved cost anywhere they could on the structure, the touchpad is literally painful to use, mentally and physically.
