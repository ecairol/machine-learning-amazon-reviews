I'm a huge fan of Chromebooks as I love the simplicity of them. They are lightweight, easy to handle and navigate. I currently own 2 other Chromebooks from Acer and Toshiba and the overall quality has been the same. I assumed the same for this one. I chose this one for my wife because she liked the color. However, I was a little disappointed with the quality of the machine. It feels cheaper and flimsier than the others I own. I don't like how slippery it is to handle. The mouse pad tracks poorly and bought and wireless mouse just to help. This won't keep me from buying another Chromebook, just one made by ASUS.
