Sleek and Versatile
This computer boots up very quickly and so far I've only had one issue with it.  For some reason I had to lock the rotation on it because it continually opens up rotated in the wrong direction.  I have a Lenovo Yoga as well, it's a little smaller, but I love it also.  This one is a lot heavier, which may make me travel with the Yoga and leave this one at home.The backlit keyboard, screen, and the mouse trackpad all look great and work well.  I never have any issues with the trackpad with my Lenovo's, I'm grateful for that!  It features Windows 10 and Cortana, both of which I am still getting used to, but it seems to be very smooth and seamless.I watch a lot of videos and movies and this laptop can handle it.  For Netflix I just needed to install Microsoft Silverlight and seconds later I was watching a movie.  Perfection.I've only been using this laptop for a few weeks, so I will update if I notice anything else worthy of a mention.
