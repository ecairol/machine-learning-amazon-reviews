Great product
Met all my expectations, plus.............I was particularly happy that it came with both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.It came with Windows 8.1 but was easily updated to Windows 10.The price was the best I could find for this product and very reasonable.Other companies had the same product at a much higher price.
