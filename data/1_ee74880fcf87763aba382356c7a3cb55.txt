This laptop is perfect for surfing the web
This laptop is perfect for surfing the web, email, and small stuff like that- exactly what I wanted it for. Its cheap, very lightweight and by the track pad is bubbled but for $250 you really can't expect much. Its functioning as needed so I'm happy with my purchase as of now. there is no disc drive, but I knew that and bought an external one on amazon for $23. I also use an exterior mouse and makes using the laptop much more enjoyable! Windows 8.1 is awful and I hate it!!! I want the start button back!!!!!
