Very good for the price.
I bought this laptop to mostly browse the Internet and video chat, as well as to stream games from my iMac (this laptop is not fit for heavy gaming) from time to time.It comes with the lowest-of-the-low-end version of Windows 8.1. This may be good or bad, depending on how you look at it. On one hand, it's inexpensive and contributes to the low cost of the laptop. On the other hand, it is crippled in terms of features. Regardless, this does not bother me personally, as I immediately wiped it when I got it and installed Ubuntu 14.10. I can also confirm that it runs Windows 7 just fine, provided you already have a copy of it.The laptop, unsurprisingly, is built out of cheap plastic and feels like it could break easily. This makes me think they provide the 1-year accidental damage protection for a reason. Take great care when handling it.Its performance is adequate for what I need it for, and it does not put out much heat at all.Overall, I would recommend this laptop if you're on a budget and need an inexpensive computer, or if you don't need too much power and would prefer to spend less.
