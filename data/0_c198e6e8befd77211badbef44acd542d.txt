Either this is is a joke or I got a bad egg
Pros:-Has a good feel to it, feels nice. +1 starCons:-A 2.5" HDD will NOT, I repeat, will NOT fit in the empty sata drive slot, it is too thick. You will need to use an SSD for storage, which kind of is ridiculous for a GAMING laptop, where games nowadays take up nearly 50-60GB.-Cannot find where the ram is located without ripping out the entire board-Bottom of touchpad feels like it's bulging out a bit-GTX 950M is only getting 4 fps in FurMark, whereas the Intel HD 520 is getting 6 fps in FurMark (??? has to be a bad card right???)-Right shift button is too small, I constantly hit the up arrow when I need to shift.The HUGE complaint was the graphic card, it probably IS a bad card, but this is the review for the product for my first impression. Honestly, this is a terrible gaming laptop if you need to buy a large capacity SSD.
