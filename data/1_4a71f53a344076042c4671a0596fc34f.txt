Very happy!
I love the iPad air! So light and easy to use. I have played with other iPad but this is the first one I have owned and I love it! Also a great price! 15 dollars cheaper than if I had ordered from Apple it's self! 15 dollars might not be much but it was enough to also get me a case! Over all very pleased! It also came a day early which  was great I was so excited when I got it.
