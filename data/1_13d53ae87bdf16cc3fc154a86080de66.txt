A Student's Review
This is an amazing laptop as long as it is bought for the right person. I am currently a full time student who really needs a laptop on the go. On this laptop I have Microsoft Office 2013 (not Office365), Adobe Acrobat XI Pro, McAfee Internet Security Suite and some other light applications. The first time I did updates, I was really scared because I saw that toward the end there was only 224MBs remaining. However, after the update was completed, it shows approximately 2.26GB remaining. In order to combat, the low storage space remaining, I went ahead and bought a Sony 64GB SD card for only $25 on Amazon. That was a great buy! As of now, I only have my applications on the SSD. All of my documents, photos, and videos are kept on the memory stick. I have no complaints about the keyboard, in fact, I really like it. The keys actually go in, and is pretty responsive. As far as the trackpad is concerned, it definitely could use some improvements. At first, using it was a hassle, after 3-4 days, it became second nature. The performance for this laptop is okay as long as you're not planning on using Photoshop. I use Adobe Acrobat Pro XI, which can be a very demanding software, a lot on this machine. So far, I have not had any issues. Video playback seems to be very good. One problem I did notice was when I was running Chrome. Having 2 or 3 tabs, along with iHeart Radio, seemed to create a distortion for the audio. The audio would just stop and then restart. The battery on this laptop is pretty amazing. The battery seems to be on for around 6 hours and 30 minutes, at low brightness, no audio, and only mild surfing and word processing. The laptop color scheme is a lot better person when you actually hold it rather than looking at it in front of a computer screen. The $25 Microsoft.com voucher and free Office365 membership for 1 year is a total steal. I think that this will help out a lot of students that are going off to college this year, or someone with a tight budget. The screen is usual. You will not be able to see the pixels on the display, unless you are staring at it close. The laptop is fanless, so there isn't noise being generated by the laptop. Also, there isn't any heat. I had a HP Pavilion laptop before that generated so much heat that it became unbearable to use unless I had a pillow underneath it. This laptop does produce some heat, but hardly any. You won't be able to feel it unless you're wearing short, and it comes into direct contact with your skin.  As a student who uses this laptop daily, I can gladly recommend this laptop to the majority.UPDATE: I have created two backups of the recovery partition, and will be calling HP soon to ask if the recovery partition can be deleted, as that will free up around 7.30GB.[UPDATE 2/18/15]: So I have been using this laptop for about 4 months now, and have to say how amazed I continue to be with this laptop. The keyboard is great, and I have not been having any problems using it.The trackpad also hasn't caused me any problems yet.My only problem would be in regards to the RAM and SSD. I constantly get error messages notifying me that I am running out of space. Windows has also closed all of my running programs to increase RAM. This is quite frustrating. Also, the SSD is a major problem as well. Before, I had Adobe Acrobat XI and Microsoft Office 2013 installed, but could not install any updates due to the lack of space. I deleted Acrobat XI, and got back around 1.2GB, but it eventually got reduced to 900MB due to more updates. The recovery partition is approximately 7.2 GB, and CANNOT BE DELETED.Trying to delete it tampers with the security feature on board, and it will disable you from accessing the Windows operating system. In order to bypass this, I will try to install Windows 7 Ultimate on this laptop by disabling UEFI Secure Boot, and if it successful, then I will try to delete the recovery partition.The battery life is excellent, however the laptop does get somewhat heated after 2-3 hours of use, not unbearable by any means.The display is average, nothing to really admire about.Playing YouTube videos can be a frustrating experience. Playing in 720P does not start any problems, however, if you decide to play in 1080P, be prepared to see a lot of stuttering. I have installed the Magic Actions for YouTube, and have seen all the issues that I was experiencing go away.The following are my settings for this addon:- Enable Auto HD [It will be selected at 480p by default, change this to HD720p or HD1080p. If you do not have fast internet, I would recommend that you keep it at 480p.]- Hide Ads [Enable this as it will prevents any ads from appearing. If you are looking for an ad-free experience in Chrome, I would highly recommend that you install Adblock from https://www.getadblock.com/]- Speed Booster [I also choose this option as it loaded 720p videos much faster, I didn't see a significant difference with 1080p.]- Use MP4/AVC video stream when available [This is going to change the video file format. Using MP4/AVC will reduce the CPU usage, which will aid in a stutter free video watching experience.]*** I will update this video in another two months.*** ***If you have any questions, feel free to ask below.*** ***I spend a lot of time writing reviews.
