Hisense Pulse vs. VIZIO Co-Star
I had previously purchased the VIZIO Co-Star last summer (directly from VIZIO) and have been pretty happy with it.  However, since I did not have previous experience with GoogleTV, I figure that I would give Hisense a whirl to have a better point of comparison and I also needed another GTV device for use in another room.Initial thoughts on the Pulse: Functionality is somewhat similar to Co-Star with some different features.  Most notable feature would be the microphone.  However, since GTV3.0 hasn't rolled out (I think it's expected this month some time), this feature cannot be used, tested, nor reviewed until an update is made available.  IR Blaster is the next difference.  Honestly, I think VIZIO got it right, in this regard, by building it the remote.  My TV is mounted on the wall, but my satellite box and GTV unit are sitting a bit lower to the ground.  I can't seem to find the exact angle to point the IR Blaster cable to enable control of all my devices.  It's a bit annoying to try and use the Pulse remote to control basic functions for all my devices and have to tweak the IR Blaster cable's position, I just end up just using my other devices' remotes.  With Co-Star, I just point and click, it works without grabbing another remote!  Last difference, LED light in the front.  I keep both GTV devices powered on, at all the times.  The Pulse LED light only turns on when it's off, so despite the fact that Co-Star does not have a front facing LED (it has one in the back), I still can't tell if the Pulse is on or, for some reason, unplugged/unpowered just from a quick glance.Apples to Apples Comparison:Remote: Pulse has a slight edge due only to one factor, the touchpad.  Although the remote doesn't feel as high quality as Co-Star's, the touchpad is smoother than the Co-Star's remote.  Other than that, the button layout on the Pulse takes a little getting used to.  Co-Star's remote button layout seems more intuitive.  Another thing about the Pulse remote, (and I probably wouldn't have noticed this, if I hadn't owned the Co-Star first), it lacks digit buttons.  It's not a deal breaker to have to flip the remote, but with Co-Star, I can change the channel of my satellite box, like a traditional remote.  The deal breaker is the IR Blaster for the Pulse, as mentioned before.  Unless all your devices' IR receivers are on the same plane or general area, it's a hassle.**UPDATE 1/16** I'm not sure if this has anything to do with my DirecTV box (H21-200), but I get what seems like key repeats are transmitting from the Pulse (via IR blaster) to my DirecTV receiver.  This occurs when I use the Page Up/Down (or Channel Up/Down on the remote) in the DirecTV channel guide.  It doesn't happen every time, but maybe one out of five times, after trying to scroll down or up (has occurred in either direction) the Pulse thinks that I'm holding down the key and my DirecTV receiver keeps receiving messages (which is indicated by a flashing LED on the DirecTV).  My channels go from 500s all the way down to the 300s.  I try reversing directions, by pressing the opposite direction button, but it does nothing and I just have to wait until it stops transmitting.  Quite annoying to say the least. **UPDATE 1/16**Audio: Where's the 5.1 pass thru?  I'm not an audio expert by any means, but I know I'm a surround sound fiend.  If an end-user uses a Blu-ray player as the source (instead of a cable/satellite box), then you would lose 5.1 with the Pulse.  Sad.  Co-Star has 5.1 pass thru, so the Pulse loses in this respect.  Point goes to VIZIO.Video: On two occasions, after powering on my devices (TV, audio, and satellite box), I did not see a picture.  One of the times, I heard audio, and the other time no audio was present either.  It seems that the Pulse has some HDCP/HDMI communication issues.  I experienced this early on with the Co-Star, but after one of their updates it was resolved.  I never had a problem since.  I know it's not my HDMI cables, since the same cables work with Co-Star, it just seems to be intermittent with the Pulse.  Another point goes to VIZIO, well at least until Hisense releases an update to resolve this.  BTW, I have the latest 3.4.1 update.GUI (Graphic User Interface): Pulse has the standard GoogleTV interface, as seen on devices like LG's TV with GoogleTV.  It works, but I think I've been spoiled by Co-Star's UI.  On the Pulse, when you select the icon to see all the apps installed, the app screen overlays the TV image (although you can still hear sound).  Co-Star's app interface is less intrusive and only covers a portion of the left side of the image.  So you can continue to watch TV, while checking (or showing off to your friend) out the latest downloaded apps.  Yet another point goes to VIZIO.Apps: Many people writing reviews for both these devices complain about not having a Hulu app and blame the brand.  Um, hello... this problem is between GoogleTV and Hulu, and not the manufacturer of GoogleTV devices.  There are alternate ways to "side load" apps to enable Hulu content (*cough* Plex, with a PC), but until GoogleTV and Hulu come to an agreement, there won't be an app in the Play Store available.  So for those customers, who returned either unit based on this fact alone, do your homework first!  Nothing on Hisense or VIZIO's websites state that Hulu is available on either of their platforms.  Sorry for the rant, back to the review.  The PrimeTime app is awesome, good job Google!  On the packaging, Hisense says that VUDU is available.  It's neither preinstalled nor available in the Play Store.  So, either it's yet another feature (like the microphone) that's waiting for GTV3.0, or they are misrepresenting their product.  For now, it's back to Flixter's port of VUDU/UV titles.  Lastly, I'm not sure if it's a licensing issue, but I can only play games using the OnLive app with the Co-Star and not on the Pulse.  I can only watch other people play games on the Pulse, although briefly entertaining, how fun can it be not being able to play?  It's like watching an older sibling or a friend hog a video game controller for a 1P game (no, I'm not traumatized or anything).  Point, VIZIO.Overheating and freezing OS issues?  I'll admit, Co-Star runs a little warmer than the Pulse, but it's not that much of a difference.  I use a Targus Chill Mat (I think the model I bought is designed for netbooks, for $5 from Amazon a while ago) and it keeps either device nice and cool.  As for the OS freezing on either device, I keep these occurrences at bay by periodically power cycling (unplugging the cord of) the unit.  Like most Android smartphones and/or tablets, you have to reboot the unit from time to time, to ensure that memory leakage is limited, at least this is my theory.  GTV devices are not like your everyday stream players, Roku or AppleTV devices (aka one-trick ponies), and have a much more robust OS with (almost) endless possibilities with many, many apps at your disposal.  Rebooting is somewhat to be expected, IMHO.  (Except when reboots are required to recover non- audio/video issues, there's just no excuse for that.)In conclusion, I will have to give the Pulse, 2 stars.  Although basic functionality is somewhat the same as Co-Star's and based on the experience I shared above, I have to deduct points.  Co-Star seems like a better horse to bet on, for now.  I might come back and give it another point depending if the microphone functionality works well...  **UPDATE 1/16** The GTV3.0 update better be pretty good, based on my remote update (see above), the Pulse's score should drop by another point but I will keep it at 2 for now.  If there is no firmware update to remedy this issue, I'll have to drop their rating to 1 star. **UPDATE 1/16**GTV rant:  GTV is not for everyone.  But, if you don't mind a slight learning curve, not being stuck with whatever apps that "they" (a' la one-trick ponies) pre-install for you, and have a knack for a slightly more technologically advanced device, try Google TV (and my recommendation for now, prior to other devices being released this year, would be Co-Star).
