I've had it 3 weeks and it was a great deal.  Not sure why it runs slow for some people. Plenty fast for me. I did remove the sample programs it came with, especially the  virus checker, switched to free Windows Defender. Don't like Windows 8.1 interface, so downloaded startisback, a $3 download that makes using a Windows 8 computer work like Windows 7.What I love the most (besides the 219 price I paid) is how smooth the multitouch trackpad works. The machine works well for web browsing, email, printing, Netflix, Youtube, etc, reasonably fast, no buffering or stuttering delays w video.  Also, runs impressively long on the battery for a cheap laptop. Extremely quiet, does have a fan, but I can't hear it, even in a silent room, unless I put my ear right on the computer. Runs cool, has a tiny charge brick that uses barely more juice than my phone charger. very good wifi connection speed.What I don't like: No indicator lights, not even a power on light, no caps lock light, no hard drive light. I don't really use a number pad, so it is wasted space to me.I don't miss DVD drive, haven't used DVDs for at least a year, and I have a cheap external DVD drive if I should ever need one.
