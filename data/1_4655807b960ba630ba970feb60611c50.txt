I was hoping for a bit more for 800 bucks.
I really wanted to give this computer 5 stars, but I just couldnt.Overall the computer is nice it has a metal case and the light up keyboard which is nice.I do love the 4 USB ports and the Camera,bluetooth,and microphone feature.Overall the computers touchpad and keyboard are so far seem to be very good quality.Obviously windows 8 is junk and windows 10 comes out in a few days so I am going to switch over as soon as possible since they are bringing back the windows 7 theme which I think everyone can agree is well needed. The i7 processor makes things go a lot faster and you can see the difference very quickly once switching from i5 to i7. I also like the ssd card slot.Cons: I do not like the fact that It has a inboard battery.I dislike the fact that there are two seperate on board hardrives which one is for operating system files and the other is for personal, this takes the 256gb and splits in half.The biggest problem for me is the speakers. They are terrible and I cannot get them to go any louder. Probably because they put the speakers on the bottom of the computer instead of where every computer company normally puts them on the top. The computer claims to have clear and powerful sound ,but that is a lie.Other then that the computer is very nice and heavy, I will enjoy it, I will contact Asus and find out why the speakers arent loud at all. I will keep an update in a little while after I have had time to play around with this new upgraded graphics card.
