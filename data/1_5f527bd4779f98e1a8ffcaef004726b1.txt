great but lacking sound clarity and loudness
I had also ordered a acer 11 inch chrome book, i like this one much better, it is easier to see, it runs faster, it is more user friendly, the key pad is bigger, and overall i think the difference of the cost is worth it.Update after using it a bit i did find that the sound quality is lesser than on this compared to the acer chromebook 11, it seems like the difference is the speaker outlet section on the back is bigger on the acer than this one.
