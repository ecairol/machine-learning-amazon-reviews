Nothing worked!
We had this box for about 3 days before deciding to return it.  It had no problems connecting to our wireless, but it had problems doing just about everything else.The real turn on for us to purchase this was the HBOGo App.  DirecTV doesn't support this app for Roku, so we were very excited to replace our Roku 1 with it.  Well the App doesn't load fully, the box won't connect to Netflix.  Another reason to get it was the Chrome browswer and YouTube App.  My husband enjoys watching eSports, and the YouTube app "couldn't" find his channel and Chrome would crash every 5 minutes making watching his matches painful.  On top of all that the remote didn't connect to any of our other devices (Satellite box, receiver, tv)... Waste of time and money... We'll be getting the Roku 3 or hopefully a better GoogleTV box.
