Major Issues
I really hate giving this a 2 star rating because I really enjoyed it for the first couple of weeks I had it.  But, I have to.  Out of nowhere the "search" window feature which allows you to browse you apps etc. just began to pop up and display even without me clicking it.  It gets to the point where it pops up, disappears, then pops up again- repeatedly.  When this happens, for whatever reason it then causes the number key row to not work, which means the backspace key also doesn't work.  Very, very frustrating.  Will be seeking to return if possible.
