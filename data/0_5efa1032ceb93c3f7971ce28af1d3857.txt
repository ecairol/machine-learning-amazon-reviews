Save your money, don't buy a Vizio
Bought this tv locally a week ago to use as a monitor for my PS4. Setup was easy and it worked fine for the first day, then we noticed the screen darkening randomly but thought it was just the game we were playing. Then Thanksgiving day it stopped turning on unless you removed and re-inserted the power cable. This is exactly 5 days after initial purchase and is apparently a very common problem. According to their site the power cable process is an acceptable solution...hardly. I will be returning it this week and buying a different brand.I would not reccomend Vizio as a purchase to anyone, do some searching if you are considering purchasing this or any other Vizio offering.
