Excellent purchase for the money
I bought the Asus Zenbook based on reviews, both here on Amazon and other PC websites.  I needed to edit documents on the go and surf the internet without having to charge as much as possible.  For the money, the Zenbook met all of my requirements.  I'm still learning Windows 8.1, but so far so good.  If you need to a computer to simultaneously play video games and edit 4K movies, then spend some real money and get a more expensive computer with all the specs you are looking for.  If you need a workhorse to edit PDFs and word documents, surf the internet, or engage any other moderate processor tasks, then don't hesitate to buy this laptop.I wish it had a backlit keyboard, but for the money it's a steal.  Fanless Core M Processor, no moving-parts hard drive, plenty of RAM, 3 x USB 3.0 ports, SD card reader, mini hdmi.....all for $700?  Stop wasting your time like I did and buy this sucker.
