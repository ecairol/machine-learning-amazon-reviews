nice user experience for a budget laptop
An affordable, simple laptop for college students whose majors don't require a more powerful or graphics-friendly laptop.  Here are a few points to consider:-The build of the ASUS Chromebook feels very sturdy for a low-end laptop.-Trackpad responsiveness is also nice-- smooth and responsive.-Keyboard seems large for a budget laptop, with keystrokes registering solidly.-Great battery life of around 10-11 hours.-The ASUS prefers to do a few things at once, so it may lag or stutter when users have zillions of windows open.  If you are a major multi-tasker, a different Chromebook might be preferable (check the current Acer and HP reviews to evaluate options).-Like so many budget laptops, this model has a glossy screen.  Some will find this beautiful, while others will find it annoying.  If dealing with glare and limited viewing angles will drive you crazy, you may want to keep looking for a matte screen.
