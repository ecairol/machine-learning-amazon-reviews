Good but Cloud Storage is Not included!
I love my chromebook. It works well, and has a fantastic battery life. However, I am giving it 3 stars because it offers 100GB Google Drive storage with purchase, but this is not the case. It says an offer will be sent to you upon purchase. I never received an offer. I sent a message to Google Drive, but never received a response. I bought the chromebook to replace my main laptop. Cloud storage is vital on a chromebook, and not receiving my 2 year storage is very upsetting.
