Great budget laptop.
Nice machine, battery time is limited to a few hours. Very large. Lightweight for it's size though. Processor is slow as expected, but adequate for web browsing and using my remote access charting system for work. Very slow to load videos and movie trailers, slower than my 5 year old lenovo or my phone, so I know it's not the internet connection. It has problems processing that amount of date all at once.I enjoy this laptop and for the price it's a great machine.
