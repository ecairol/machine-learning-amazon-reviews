Defective SD card slot but overall nice portable laptop
Overall very nice for the price. Only issue I have is that the SD card slot seems defective on mine. It doesn't ever lock the SD card into place, just ejects it, no matter how far in I push it it just never clicks. It is the standard "push-push" design.Kinda a disappointment since that is the easiest way to expand the memory (unless you want to put a small USB in permanently).
