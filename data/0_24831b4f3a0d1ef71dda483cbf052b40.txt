Don't expect this TV to work when connected to WiFi!!
Vizio has a known problem with wi-fi networks and IT IS NOT JUST THIS MODEL!!It will connect, but if you have other devices on your wireless network the TV is very likely to lock up and become unresponsive to the remote.Vizio support spent quite awhile trying to convince me that it was the remote that needed replacing.When they finally gave me the real reason, their only solution was to turn off "file sharing" on my wifi router.What this means is that the router would then prevent all devices on wifi from talking to each other through the router. No file sharing between PC's, no access to the my wireless printer, no chromecast, etc. etc.  gutting the functionality of my network.No other device on my network has any problem whatsoever working on my wifi.Returned this poorly designed product and bought a Samsung... which works perfectly.Paid more, but it actually works as a smartTV.
