I was hesitant to buy another ASUS product, as I've had problems with their hardware before. Three months later I'm still ecstatic about my decision. I have the black, Core M, version.Pros:The Core M processor is surprisingly fast.Enough RAM for multitasking basic applicationsCore M, SSD, and integrated graphics chip mean no fans, no noise, and portability.Very light weight.Long battery life, 8 hours with intermittent use. It can sit for a day or two unused and still have some life left in it.Matte screen, which I prefer to the glare on more reflective screens. Also, smudges are not as visible on matte screens.Cons:Keyboard is not back-lit. Which is mostly an inconvenience, somewhat remedied by using full brightness in the dark.It gets a little warm, especially sitting on your lap
