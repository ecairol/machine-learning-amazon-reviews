Highly Recommended!
I absolutely LOVE this laptop!!  I have owned Dell's and HP Ultrabooks, and this is my favorite laptop by far. It is lightweight but very fast and the screen is vibrant.  It's a 13.3 inch screen but it never feels cramped.My only negatives are that the speakers are not great (headphones work great though) and I wish it had a lit keyboard.  Other than that, I have only positive things to say about it.
