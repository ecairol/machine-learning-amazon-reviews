What good is a Ferrari with a broken steering wheel
First let me say that this laptop is gorgeous. Second, let me say, I can't wait to return it.Despite having the performance, quality-feel, and all the features I thought I'd want in an ultrabook, the trackpad makes it absolutely useless. Think the track pad is no big deal? Try to interface with your computer without it. Try browsing, reading a long PDF, or moving around google maps with a trackpad that refuses to scroll. It maybe responds 10% of the time. I switched to this laptop exclusively for two weeks hoping this was just something I needed to get adjusted to. I even passed it around my office during some of my presentations, and my coworkers trying to simply take notes called it unusable.I would love love love for this to be the machine that its specs make it out to be. I could fill TWO reviews with the positive features of this laptop.  With an unusable trackpad, and a less-than-stellar keyboard though, none of those other features matter.Before purchasing, I highly recommend you search the web for trackpad complaints for the xps13. Half the poor saps are looking for driver updates. I wish a driver update could reverse Dell's decision to use the Microsoft "precision" trackpad. I'd keep this thing if they issued a recall.Maybe I'll buy a cheapy, and hope that they fix this in the 2016 model.
