Terrible touchpad, external mouse needed
What everyone has said about the hardware is true - it's probably one of the best windows laptops, and certainly the best Dell laptop, to have come out in recent years. However, don't get too excited.The touchpad/trackpad on this thing is horrendous. Dell managed to really shoot themselves in the foot by using what seems to be the cheapest trackpad they could find on this otherwise very nice laptop. Here are the problems, even after the latest touchpad firmware update (at the time of this writing):1. Two finger scrolling stops working randomly.2. Cursor will randomly jump around the screen.3. No way to configure gestures, click-on-tap, etc. - I never thought I would be saying this, but I wished there was a third-party software to control the touchpad. Dell has surrendered the Touchpad driver responsibilities to Microsoft, and there is nothing you can do.4. Cursor will move when you lift the finger off the touchpad, or when you press down to click - this makes clicking on small icons very difficultThis laptop gets 2 stars, because once I connected an external mouse to it, everything worked fine. But the touchpad should have been better. I noticed the issue within 20 minutes of first boot. This is a shame, because this laptop would have been close to perfect.Do a Google search for "XPS 13 9343 Touchpad Issues", and you will see that this is a common issue with this laptop.
