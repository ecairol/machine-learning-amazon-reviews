User experience was poor.
My first impression was good, but as I further experienced the Hisense Pulse, the bugs and remote control made it umbarrenly frustrating. From annoying bugs, like the clock never synced, to significant bugs, like apps crashing. Chrome crashed over and over. The remote control  was the final straw. Trying to use the track pad was the most frustrating experience I've ever had browsing the internet. The majority of my time on the Pulse was spent browsing. The track pad would rarely work. It was almost impossible to select a link. As a result of these issues, and others not mentioned, I decided to finally return the product and receive a refund.I was most disappointed, as I spent much effort reading reviews on the product, and I never encountered any major complaints. It makes me wonder why users would tolerate a product that clearly needs refinement.In closing... If the product, for the most part, was bug free, it would be awesome, but for now it is intolerable.
