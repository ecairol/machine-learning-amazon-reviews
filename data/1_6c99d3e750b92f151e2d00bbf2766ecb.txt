Practical, cheap, does what you need
This is the Corolla of laptops.  Practical, cheap, and does what you need.I noticed considerable choppiness and lag when more than 3-4 tabs are open at a time.This is more like your daily driver, and less of a performance machine.  Perfect for just having an extra computer in your living room for when you need to type up a longer email or see a full-screen calendar.User interface super easy to figure out.
