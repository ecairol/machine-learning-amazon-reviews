Bad Trackpad Buttons
I love this laptop, it's small and portable with a gorgeous matte screen that meets my resolution requirement of 1080p. The only reason I can't give this five stars is because the area on the track-pad that SHOULD right click, OFTEN left clicks and makes doing things incredibly annoying. The sensitivity for the tap to click function is far too high and I ended up having to turn it off because of misclicks while simply moving around. The entire track-pad is also a button, which I personally dislike, as opposed to having two buttons beneath the track-pad. Another thing that happens is I hit a dead zone often when I try to use two fingers on the track-pad (one to click the button and the other to move around) as I have become accustomed to, using other laptops. Lastly, I figured 4GB of RAM would be enough for a computer that I'm just going to use to browse the web and do some hobby programming using MSVS, but I find myself hitting 75-80% of memory used frequently with only Firefox opened; 8GB would have been far more comfortable. The webcam as you will see noted all over the place, is also in a weird position. The keyboard is great and the key travel is very comfortable and satisfying. The keyboard back light makes typing at night a breeze. Windows 10 was a bit difficult to install though, as when setting the laptop up it asked me if I wanted to upgrade; choosing yes it said it would download in the background... it never downloaded and I never saw another mention of it again. I had to download and install 160+ updates, then do some BATCH file wizardy, before I finally managed to upgrade, but that's most probably Windows fault.Other than the negatives I've listed, the laptop is perfect.
