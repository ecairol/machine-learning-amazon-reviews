Nice laptop at a great price
I'm very pleased with my new laptop. It has worked just fine for me. I am impressed with how cool it stays while running. I like having all of the connections that this laptop comes with and am using almost all of them. I have it running as if it were a desktop computer, with the lid closed and a keyboard, mouse, and monitor plugged in, along with always running with the charger.The minuses are not huge but are worth mentioning. The display of streaming media from local tv websites is ok, but not great. Pressing keys on my keyboard will not wake up the laptop from sleeping. I have checked the device settings and the usb-connected keyboard should be able to wake it up. No big deal, I just open the lid, press the power button, and then shut the lid, and it fires up quickly. The keyboard will wake it up if it's only been sleeping a short while, but not after sleeping overnight.
