Love the long battery life
Love the long battery life. Hate the needs of constantly refreshing the tab. Only suitable if you open one or two tab at once. The memory cannot handle multiple tabs open at once. I returned the chromebook, now using macbook pro retina 13 inch, which  I am enjoying these days.
