It runs great games with higher demand graphics like Guild wars 2
The person I bought this for hasn't received it yet, but I have the exact same model and I have had it for 4 years now. This particular model does not come with a DVD drive but that's small potatoes when it comes to the rest of the lap tops functionality. I sought out this laptop specifically because of it's capabilities. It runs great games with higher demand graphics like Guild wars 2, Sims (3 and 4), it doesn't run hot, it's very capable of running several programs at once. Love it.
