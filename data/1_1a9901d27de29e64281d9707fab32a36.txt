This review is for the ASUS Zenbook UX305LA 13.3-Inch 8GB 256GB for $749.99This laptop is without a doubt the highest value I have seen for an ultrabook in this price range. This machine is quick, quiet, and efficient. To top it off, it can last an extremely long time on a single charge.You'll notice right away that the machine runs everyday programs without trouble. Programs such as Explorer/Chrome, Word, Excel, Adobe, etc. With the combination of the i5, and the high amount of ram, this machine can even run some games. Nothing revolutionary, but simpler light games to keep you occupied. The amazing part is not the fact that it can play games. It's amazing because at a low cost, you have a decent work laptop that is a little over 2lbs and has 8gb of ram with a higher than average SSD for storage. I won't quote any prices to part comparison here because you can just as easily verify it yourself with whatever you are using to read this review.The second point of interest is how quiet this thing is. There are fans in this laptop, but you'll rarely hear it. You can watch a nice quiet scene in a movie and it won't make a peep. Some models out there are quiet and some don't have any fans, but in my experience, you are better off with a fan. Electronics get hot. That seems like a dumb statement to point out, but think about how they have fanless laptops. They have to underclock everything to make it cool enough to run or else there are serious risk of damage to the components. I feel like you get the best of both worlds here.Finally, when I say that this machine is efficient, I mean the battery will actually last a fairly long time on normal settings and not quoted by throwing it in a freezer, on the lowest power settings, with the screen turned off. I mean you can use it to write a paper, browse the internet, chat with friends, or watch a movie with said friends. Of course watching a movie on the nice 1080p screen will drain the battery more quickly, but typically this 8-10 hour battery will last you anywhere from 5-7 hours when in daily use.This laptop is not without some flaws or things I wish it had. There is no backlit keyboard, the quality of the product may vary wildly due to some QA issues with ASUS (more on this later), the power button is right above the backspace key, and the mic will pick up typing and sounds from your laptop quite loudly. I can't say the last one is a flaw, because most laptops do that due to the general placement of the hardware. Also, an important note to people that may want to upgrade individual parts: It is extremely hard/labor intensive/impossible to replace some parts on this laptop due to the soldering. You give up those options to have a sleek light laptop. Not a flaw, just a fair warning. This also means if something breaks... you are in for a world of hurt.Which brings me back to ASUS and their QA troubles. For some reason, ASUS or the their subcontractors cannot get a consistent quality assurance program going. They have had trouble since the release of the first few zenbook models. Many people love their zenbooks. In fact, I love my zenbook, but many people also hate it because of reports of machine that are dead on arrival, dead shortly after arrival, or malfunctions mostly due to the corruption of the SSD.Personally, that is why I gave this machine a 4 star rating. My first one had a bad SSD soldered on and my second one had a faulty fan. It would make a weird and loud clicking noise shortly after being turned on. To be clear, I could hear it over the movie/game sounds that were turned up quite a bit. However, the third time is the charm, I guess. No problems so far and amazon was amazing about the returns. I just wish the first one worked out of the box.Just test your machine out before you really commit to it. Make sure there are no dead pixels by changing the background to black then white. Also make sure to get the latest drivers from various websites. You can download the Intel Update Utility to easily update the wireless and Bluetooth adaptor  (which has problems and is really slow as stock). Also make sure to use every aspect of the computer and run it for a few days to see if anything strange happens.Hope this review helps!EDIT 11/05/2015.,;'*^-.,;'*^-.,;'*^-.,;'*^-FOR THOSE WITH WIFI PROBLEMS.
