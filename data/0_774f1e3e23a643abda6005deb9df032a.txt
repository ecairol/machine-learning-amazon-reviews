BAD POOL HEADER ===INFECTION OF INTERNAL HARD DRIVE == STAY CLEAR FROM THIS
MY TOSHIBA CAME INFECTED WITH: BAD POOL HEADER; A VERY BAD HARD DRIVE INFECTION; GOT A REFUND. I didn't turn this on till 7/15/15 and then had to have Toshiba rest to original settings (this is my first laptop and I messed something up and got completely locked out - and this is a feature I do not like -) I was trying to change the log on password to None so that the laptop doesn't turn off (causing me to have to sign in each time I come back to it ---- even if I am gone 10 minutes) - Well, I failed in my attempts to "fool" the laptop.  I haven't turned it back on as yet.I am trying to find out  how to reach the seller, as 'Toshiba has requested a copy of the receipt - photo download - and I didn't not get a receipt with the laptop for some reason -- also, now my printer is broken.So I need a receipt mailed to me.****** I FEEL I MUST ADD THIS:  I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO USE MY LAPTOP BECAUSE EVERY TI ME I LOG ONTO TO IT, MICROSOFT SHUTS ME DOWN WITH THIS PROMPT:  YOU HAVE A "BAD POOL HEADER"  WE NEED TO RESTART ;  THIS LAPTOP HAS CRASHED EVERYTIME SINCE TOSHIBA RESET MY LAPTOP AFTER I BOUGHT IT.  I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED.  AT THIS POINT I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO. I AM STILL RECOUPING FROM SPINAL SURGERY AND CANNOT DRIVE TO TAKE IT ANYWHERE, SO I AM BACK TO THIS MY OLD COMPUTER. I  HOPE THIS IS JUST AN ISOLATED INCIDENT.
