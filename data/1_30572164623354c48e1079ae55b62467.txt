Not good for multitasking
I bought this laptop because I wanted something light and portable for school. I knew I was sacrificing power for portability, but as I don't do much on my laptop but watch Netflix and do homework, I didn't think it would be much of a problem. Unfortunately, upon receiving the laptop, I was quite disappointed. The build of the laptop doesn't seem very sturdy, and the metal finish was immediately covered in fingerprints. The box included a cleaning cloth, but even that wouldn't remove the fingerprints and it looked terrible. I didn't much care for the feel of the keyboard; the keys didn't have as much depth as I would have liked. When I finally got the laptop set up, I attempted to run updates - which failed 3 times before finally downloading. I tested out the speed on my browser and had hiccups with just 2 tabs open. The final straw came for me when I tried opening multiple Word documents - after opening 3 Word documents, Word continually crashed and couldn't handle having that many documents open. I may not do much on my computer, but I do need it to work for the few things I do. I ended up returning the laptop in favor of a tablet, which has proved to be a much better investment. If you only use this laptop for minimal browsing, it may work for you, but I wouldn't recommend it as a laptop for school.
