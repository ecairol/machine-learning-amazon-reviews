It's an inexpensive laptop, good for simple stuff, lacks power to do more.
It's a cheap laptop.  I don't like the mouse pad.  It's not very responsive to tapping, and since the left and right mouse buttons are integrated into the pad and there's no tactile way to know whether your fingers are on the buttons or the pad the mouse is sometimes hard to control.It has Windows 8 which is just crappy in my opinion.  I spend a lot of time switching back and forth to the desktop view. I can find no redeeming value to the app view on Windows 8.Processing power is limited making streaming videos jump and stutter at times.It powers up fairly quickly and is good for general day to day web-browsing.  It's fairly light and has good battery life.
