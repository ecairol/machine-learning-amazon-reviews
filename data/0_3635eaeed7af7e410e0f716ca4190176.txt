No Bueno
11/26/14 Update: Got this like 2 days ago and it wont turn on anymore. Was using it fine all morning, left for a bit, came back and its done for.  No lights saying its plugged in either.  What a piece of junk.  At least it happened well within my 30 days to return it.11/25/14Might be harsh giving it 3 stars as it just arrived tonight. First observations though is that it seems a bit top heavy and I don't like how there is no cd drive.  When I got this I knew there wasn't going to be one, but I got it on the assumption (my bad I guess) that it was too thin to include one, rather than having a blank drive where a cd drive can easily be installed. It also seems like it can be easily tipped over because the screen is much heavier than the base.  Actual functionality has (had*) been smooth, but the design isnt best.  I DO like how quiet it is.  I never heard it turn on.  The keyboard seems cheap but I think I'll get used to it.  I'll come back and update this if anything dramatically changes...
