Amazing laptop for Linunx
::: Used this laptop to install Ubuntu Linux :::::: This is for the core i5 model, not the black one with the coreM :::Amazing machine. I've been describing it as having the power of a Macbook Pro inside a Macbook Air. That is to say that it has MBP specs (almost, the CPU is slightly less powerful than the MBP) and is the size  and weight of an Air. I am using this to run Linux, mostly Ubuntu and Linux Mint so if you came here wondering if this was a good machine for Linux then this is for you.Current setup: Ubuntu 14.04, Flatabulus theme, and Ultra Flat icon pack. Its the most beautiful OS I have ever seen. I am using this for day to day web browsing and full stack web development.Price==== $750 for these specs? SOLD. A 13 inch MBair is $250 more expensive with significantly worse specs. Next runner up is the Dell XPS13 which is again, much more expensive and has worse specs. You can't beat this.The Screen========= The screen is MATTE full HD (1920x1080) which is great to look at. Because it's a matte screen, there is virtually no glare at all. It's hard enough to find matte screen these days and even harder for an ultrabook and I loath glossy screens so I instantly fell in love with this screen. My only complaint is that the resolution might be too high, the text is pretty small and requires just a little strain to read.Battery====== I 'm getting about 5 1/2 hours of battery life on this. Asus claims to have a 10 hour battery life for Windows which I cannot confirm since I have installed Linux, and Linux has always had a rocky relationship with batteries. Lowering the screen brightness seems to help, and I am currently exploring other power saving options but 5 /12 hours is fine with me as I am never away from a plug for that long.Keyboard=======The keyboard is taking me a little time to get used to. My last laptop also had one of these recessed kayboards but the keys stuck out more and had more of a mechanical feeling while typing, so I have a few more typos now but again it's just something I will need time to get used to. It was also a little larger so I had dedicated keys for things like page-up/page-down and home/end and that's actually kind of a big deal. It's been difficult for me to jump around my documents as I am typing because I have to remember that I now need to press the FN key and one of the arrow keys.  The center of the keyboard seems a little flimsy so sometimes I see the keyboard bend in while Im typing.Notes - No backlit keyboard which sucks but its not the worst thing I guess. The screen brightness keys do NOT work at all. Those are the keys that require pressing the FN button and then f5/f6. So youll either have to adjust it manually (I've only had to adjust it once to about 60%) or use these instructions:https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/301lpy/linux_on_asus_zenbook_ux305/cuwr5n7Trackpad=======The trackpad is fine, no complaints. It worked out of the box with full trackpad settings (stuff like tap to click, two finger scrolling ect).Wireless======= This worked out of the box but I do seem to be having issues staying connected to my network. Not sure what is happening yet but every so often DNS will stop resolving and I will have to reconnect to my router. It might be the router tho, I've been having issues with my chromecast.Camera======I dont use webcams that much anyway so I have a hard time comparing to anything. Resolution seems fine, motion tracking seems a bit sluggish I guess? I mean, its fine for me almost non-existent skype/hangouts session.Speakers========Tbh these aren't the greatest. They are located on the bottom of the machine and unless you are using the laptop on a hard surface like a desk it's not very loud. So I guess my desk is amplifying the sound, but it sounds muffled when on my lap. I generally use headphones anyway but it would be nice if they were on top and louder so I could play videos for people.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::TLDR: Great machine for Linux. But it now.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Pros - Beautiful, beautiful matte screen with zero glare. Incredibly lightweight but still powerful. Great specs for its size, heck they're great specs in general.  Decent battery life, all hardware works out of the box which is a HUGE pro. Portability is amazing, sometimes I forget it's even in my bag. For this price, its a GREAT machineCons - No backlit keyboard (not a big deal but they look so nice), apparently the RAM is soldered onto the mainboard so it cannot be upgraded (if you want to run multiple VMs this might be an issue) but 8gigs is OK for my need. Screen brightness key does not work in Linux. No dedicated page-up/page-down/home/end keys is really difficult for me to get used to. I wish the battery life was longer on Linux, 10 hours would be amazing. Speakers aren't the best
