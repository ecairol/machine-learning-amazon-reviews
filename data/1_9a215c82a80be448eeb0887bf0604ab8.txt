Best bang for the buck
It is a bit under powered but as many other outside reviews have said, best bang for the buck. We bought this for our middle schooler and will easily do everything she will need it to do for the next couple years.  ASUS has a 4GB RAM version that will take care of those that like to have twenty tabs open in their browser.  Over all it is hard to find a chromebook that has 10 hours of battery life and this large of a screen for such a low price.
