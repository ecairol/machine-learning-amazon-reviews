You Get What You Pay For
This laptop offers solid proof to the old adage "You get what you pay for". At a price-point of 220 USD, one should *not* expect a rock-solid chassis or other bells-and-whistles that would otherwise come with a higher-priced unit.That said, the ASUS X551MAV-EB01-B is constructed of flimsy-feeling plastic, including the touchpad and its buttons, keyboard and overall chassis. Due to the cheap plastic core, it's noisy and hollow-sounding, while typing or using the touchpad.Moreover, there's no CD / DVD optical drive which makes things a bit more cumbersome to do routine off-network / stand-alone installs.There are two things I am most disappointed about:(1) the lack of BLUE TOOTH. In this day and age, everything from my automobile to simple household gadgets offers blue tooth connectivity ... just not this ASUS laptop?!(2) For some unknown reason, Windows Updates take EXTREMELY long to download and install. I manage several computers (desktops and laptops alike) that are running Windows 8.1 and *none* of them have this issue .. only this ASUS laptop?! And, since the laptop arrived with outdated Windows 8, upgrading to Win8.1 consumed an entire evening of my time.In summary, if you are looking for a cheap (in every conceivable way) laptop, this may be for you. If you're picky about quality and functionality, then this will only leave you disappointed.
