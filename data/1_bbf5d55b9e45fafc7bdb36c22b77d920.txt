Third time's a charm?
I had to return the first two I received. The first one appeared to have a bad processor or something. It ran extremely slowly and maxed out at 0.49Ghz. The second one locked up every hour or so. So far the third one is working. I use this laptop for my small business and it doesn't lag at all. It's perfectly snappy for using the internet and MS Office.
