A good product but...CHECK YOUR PRINTER BEFORE YOU BUY!
I was happy to by this Christmas gift for my mother. It would've been her first ever laptop. She cried when she opened the box.However, the day after Christmas I sat down to add our HP Deskjet All-In-One 2540 to her laptop and found out that it wasn't compatible. Our printer, which we just bought in June, is wireless, however it is not an ePrinter. So instead of printing directly from her Chromebook using Google Cloud Print, my mom would have to use MY PC laptop as a surrogate for print jobs. This will be incredibly inconvenient in the long run. If I had known that Chromebooks don't accommodate traditional means of printing, I wouldn't have bought it at all.Now I'm looking for comparable laptops to replace this one as I must send it back. A Christmas surprise ruined! What's more is that I know that whatever computer I end up buying, I will have to spend more than the $170 that I spent on this ASUS, which was a Cyber Monday deal.The laptop in itself is fine. Very light weight and the Chrome OS is user friendly for a neophyte. The concept of a Chromebook fits for someone with basic needs like typing documents, checking e-mail, doing online banking, paying bills, etc.I would recommend this product only to someone who plans on buying a new printer along with the Chromebook. However, if you already have a printer at home, be sure to check its compatibility before you purchase it.
