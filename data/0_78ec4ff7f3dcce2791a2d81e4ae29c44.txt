the Kindle Firee HDX was superior in every respect
KINDLE FIRE HDX STOMPS APPLE iPAD AIR 5TH GEN.  It's that simple.  Side by side, the Kindle Firee HDX was superior in every respect.Outside in the most bright of sunlight, Apple failed to deliver the same screen quality that the Kindle Fire HDX could.  Kindle's processor was faster and Kindle's menu surpassed Apple's.I love my iPhone 5S and Apple delivers a solid product but this time around, the 'Academy Award' for tablets goes to the Kindle Fire HDX.
