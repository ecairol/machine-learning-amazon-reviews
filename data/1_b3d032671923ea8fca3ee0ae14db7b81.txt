For those who will use this as a Desktop Monitor
As a stand alone television, the picture quality is very good, it has a decent selection of picture modes (I personally keep it on gaming mode), the apps are not all that great because they are slow and such, but in a pinch are great in case you have to move it somewhere. The television is light weight in case you have to move it, it has mounting holes on the back which is good for couch enthusiasts, I don't really mind the reflective screen and glossy finish seeing as i hardly need to touch the television itself. The speakers are terrible, I suggest you buy some from a third party.As a computer monitor, it changes. The viewing angles up close are not that good, the edges disappear, the response time is a little bad for those into competitive shooters, but the picture quality is beautiful. Warning it may give you a headache the first day, but that will eventually go away. Discoloration is not very noticeable and when put on gaming mode, it makes it easier to look at for long periods of time.
