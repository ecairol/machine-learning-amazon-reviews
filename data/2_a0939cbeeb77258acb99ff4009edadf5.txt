Really nice TV for this price point
This is a great TV without a doubt, picture quality is very good especially after you tweak it a bit. A great feature is the audio digital out which delivers bitstream regardless of source so the receiver can decode whatever comes in. My [more expensive] Samsung cannot do this and delivers only PCM or DTS:Neo for the apps like Netflix etc.Having the 2 feet make it more stable for such a big screen if you dont wall mount and the small frame looks really good. The remote is not the best with no backlight and squishy buttons but I used a Harmony universal remote anyway so no biggie for me. I got this for a family member and wish I had kept this one and given them the Samsung which says it all really.
