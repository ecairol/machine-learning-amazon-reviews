It is not as advertised!
This computer DOES NOT have a CD drive as was advertised.  It also has something of a cheap feel to it.  It works for what I need and it was pretty inexpensive so I didn't bother to send it back, but it is not what I expected.  We have had several ASUS computers in our family so I hoped for a little more than I received.
