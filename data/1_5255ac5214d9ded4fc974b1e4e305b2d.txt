Just a thought ..
This computer feels like it's made from plastic. It feels extremely fragile. I would not travel with this laptop. I would be afraid if it breaking. BUT other than that it's a great computer it's perfect for what I need it for at home.  It's fast and really quick to turn on and off. I really can't say much about windows 8. That takes some getting used to.
