It last 6 month and stops booting
It last 6 month and stops booting. I have to send it for service and I have no way to backup my data and delete sensitive information. I am more than qualified to retrieve my data but the hard drive is inaccessible without voiding my warranty. As my mentor always says "Life is about choice". I have to choose to send the laptop with all my data and info hoping they will fix it and send it to me with the same drive(less probable) or void the warranty, retrieve my data and dump this cheap crap. I am going to sleep on it and will decide tomorrow.
