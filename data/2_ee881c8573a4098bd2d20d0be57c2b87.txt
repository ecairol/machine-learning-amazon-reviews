This is a great computer for on the go tasks
This is a great computer for on the go tasks.  I do a lot of my work in the cloud, even basic image editing, so the lack of native apps isn't a big deal for me.  I do most of my word processing in Google docs anyway, unless I'm writing on a blog.  It works great for my needs.  The only complaint I have is I'm realizing that 2GB of ram may be tight for something based on Chrome.  After using for a while, I find that switching tabs requires the tab to reload, which can be problematic  on some sites I visit.
