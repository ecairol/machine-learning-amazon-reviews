Still on the fence about this unit
My first impressions of the hisense pulse is mixed at this time. I just hooked it up today, setup was easy, instruction manual was terrible, a lot more info is needed to understand more about this product. I was not able to connect IR blaster to work with my Dish Network HDTV receiver even tho its listed in the setup feature , or my LG TV. Also Netflix would not load completely, it would start to show the red screen then stop and give message to try  Netflix help. It will not work with Amazon Prime Videos at this point, but I guess that will be coming next year when they update the software again. It does work good with YouTube, with the new app you can send videos from you smartphone or tablet to the hisense to play. I will be contacting support after Christmas to see if they can get the device to work with my Sat receiver, if not then I will return it and wait for the bugs to be worked out of it before I think about a repurchase. It a good entry price for the product, but it may be a good idea to wait for more reviews and see if update fixes some of these problems.If you watch videos they show the unit can do a voice search, however that function is not working now either, hmmmm that's in the next update as well I guess ? I will update my review if any of my problems gets resolved.Update # 1 --- Went to Hisense community and was helped with setting up the Dish Network receiver- so that is in fact working now, like i said the owners manual is no help with setting this up so  now on to the next issue.
