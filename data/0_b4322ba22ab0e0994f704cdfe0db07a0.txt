TV has potential but...
Returned the item. Ethernet port issue (defective?). TV would not connect to wired internet (we tested it multiple times on 2 network drops and confirmed it was the TV because other devices worked via those connections). Looks like the TV has potential for a nice entertainment experience. Great size and design. FYI. It was delivered via Ceva. They were prompt and courteous (although in bit of a hurry).
