was 5 stars UNTIL it started approaching a year old
PROS - lightweight, super long battery life, nice small charger, I like the chrome OS.CONS - up until about a month ago, I would've given this 5 stars.  This laptop will be 1 year old in a couple weeks.  Unfortunately, in the last month, some of the keyboard buttons don't work, including shift and some random letters.  It's super annoying b/c you're usually quickly typing and several words beyond when you realize you're missing some letters or capitalization.  And when you're typing in a masked password it's really hard to tell when the keys are acting up.Bummed b/c I otherwise loved this laptop and was even looking to get another chromebook for my husband.  If it barely lasts a year though...
