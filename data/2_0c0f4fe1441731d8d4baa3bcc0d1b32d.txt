A nice Budget College Laptop
The reason someone would buy this sort of laptop most likely would be for college. The outside and inside really do have a nice aesthetic appearance but doesn't have the "I spent 800$ vibe to it." And this is exactly the reason I bought it, college, therefore my review is based on me using it for:-College use-Browsing web/research-Microsoft Office related-Programming-Light to no gaming usage (that is why I have gaming PC!)At this price point and my usage let's see the pros and cons.PROS:-Very affordable-Decently sturdy/nice screen-Decent specs/plenty of storage/boots up FAST-Updated 8.1 (also a con to some people)-Made by ASUS-Easy to use-Stays cool and quietCONS*:-Ever so slightly heavy-Left and Right click is too hard to press (i have a mouse)-Trackpad is a bit annoying but fine (again i have a mouse)-Charging cable is too snug of a fit, DONT let people trip over it, might bring the laptop with it-NOT UPGRADE FRIENDLY. (Doesn't matter to me for my use of the laptop though, yet it is good to know!)-No cd drive (Not applicable to me)-Battery life is okay, not too long of a charge, but charges quickly.-Does leave smudges on trackpad and base of laptop from fingers.*(I use it for ONLY light use for college not really anything else, therefore the cons are biased to my use of the laptop)Some might be wondering why I don't mention the CPU speed or how it has NO BACK-LIGHT. Because I use it for school and school work I will always be in a bright lit area not doing anything CPU intensive activities like games and rendering. I've been searching for laptops for a few months now for light use at college, so far I am sold by this one. I've used it for a few days now and have Microsoft Office 365 from my University as it does NOT include Microsoft Office at all.Overall 7.9/10 Wonderful price for a new and clean laptop to do what I bought it for: school.
