Hisense Pulse VS DELL from 2001. Dell wins.....
Extremely unhappy with my Hisense Pulse. Looks pretty and very nice remote but other than that this device is worthless. Runs netflix perfectly and that is all. If you want a $100 netflix player you should buy this. This unit was outperformed in every way by my 2001 dell windows xp computer, even surfing the internet. Loads only simple web pages, do NOT try to stream play any kind of video with this equipment unless you want to stare at a black screen for 10 minutes before the unit can shut down. Skip on this item, save yourself the return time.
