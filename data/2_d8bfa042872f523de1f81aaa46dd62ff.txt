I really like this laptop
I really like this laptop.Pros:Windows 8.14GB Ram500GB Storage is more than enoughIntegrated WEBCAM and microphone are really good.Cons:The processor is sometimes slow in many CPU intensive applications, but then again, I don't use it for those apps.I recommend this laptop for users that like web browsing, skype (the web cam and integrated microphone are REALLY GOOD), and generally a portable office laptop. If you are thinking in gaming or video/music editing, forget about it.
