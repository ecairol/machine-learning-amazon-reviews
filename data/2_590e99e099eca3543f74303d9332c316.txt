Great choice
Purchased for my son to take to college. It's lightweight and the body structure is more than stable, it's son proof! Speed is great, the backlit keyboard is a plus, teens like to work in the dark.....do know there are no programs with it. Have to purchase office programs separate. I was able to link my office account to include my son's email and he had 0 issues downloading and using it.
