Bad battery life, poor screen mount, badly considered design.
Despite it's lightweight (due to a reduced battery) and aluminium there are few critical issues that made me return it.First and the most important: the display mount is really loose. A small movement might even close the lid, it almost doesn't hold it, and it pisses off a big time. It's crucial for a mobile laptops that the mount is screwed tight and holds the screen position firmly. 1 star off. The second is the battery life. I understand they wanted to reduce the price and the weight this way, but it was too much. The best I could squeeze out of the battery was 3-4 hours, that is just internet browsing (I never had anything close to the 7 hours they promise). 2 star off. The third is that "power" button placement. It's ridiculous. As someone who works a lot with documents (and press "delete" quite often) I had a real hard time re-learning not to press the power button instead of delete (and then I had to re-learn it back once again). Here goes the third star. Also, the laptop storage is split into two drives, one is SSD and the other is HDD obviously, another thing that let them keep the price low.Eventually I bought refurbished macbook air for $180 more, and I'm much more satisfied with it.
