Warning!
I wish I could say I love my iPad Air  because my kids bought it for me for Christmas.  Within a month, there was a crack across the screen.  I did NOT drop it.  It's in a ZaggFolio case with a keypad and it's a great case.  When I called Apple, they accused me of dropping it.  I can have the screen replaced for $300.  Hello?  Within the next couple of months, the web was full of people who had bought this Air and their screens were broken.  They get them replaced and they break again.  I am not able to post the link on here, but you can check out the Apple site for just a sampling of complaints and questions that you will note has not been addressed at all by Apple.There is a clearly a problem with the screen.  If you don't mind fractures across your iPad, this might be the one for you.  We are an Apple family.  Spent thousands on phones and computers for years.  So disappointed in this model.
