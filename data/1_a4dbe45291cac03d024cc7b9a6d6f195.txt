Apple sucks. There
Apple sucks.There, I said it. While I love my iphone and LOVE my ipad, those aren't incredibly overpriced compared to competitors and are unique in their own right. NOW when it comes to laptops, I had a deep internal struggle, primarily because every other "on-the-go, retro glasses-wearing" professional loves their Mac air. My frustration is not ONE apple employee could ever truly justify the price to me. "They last twice as long", "you'll never get a virus", etc - everyone knows how outdated these claims are.Enough apple hating, I looked to this guy as my work and travel journalism machine and its INCREDIBLE. SSD makes it pin drop quiet, extremely quick boot up, i5 is lightning fast, the matte screen is solid, and it has a nice, wide keyboard for on the go typing. One downside is the tiny speaker (its a laptop) and the plastic bottom supports slide easily on tables (easy home project). Did I mention the battery life is 8-9 hours? Oh and It's sold for 600-700.If you're looking at a Mac Air, just buy this instead and take the extra 300-400 and buy yourself a new suit. boom.
