Best full-sized tablet on the market
I almost bought a smaller screen tablet, but when I held the iPad Air, I couldn't believe how impossibly thin and light it feels. Plus, the rounded edges on the back make this really comfortable to hold for long periods.I'm glad I went with Apple, because the quality is unbeatable. For something I use everyday, like a tablet, it really is worth the investment. As powerful as a computer, but an absolute dream to use. The iPad Air now comes with the feature-rich word processor and spreadsheets apps, called Pages and Numbers. With included cloud-based collaborative features that can even be accessed from a PC.While there may be cheaper tablets on the market, you certainly get what you pay for. For something that you'll use everyday, from the sofa to the bed, to the coffee shop and your next flight, I would choose a quality companion. You can't do any better than this.
