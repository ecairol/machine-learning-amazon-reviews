All in all a good fit!
I bought this to replace my 4 year old Gateway laptop. It is as advertised. After the first power up and setting my account up I was ready to go.I am pleased with the speed and internet connection. I'm not a gamer and it's main use is for being on the net, and for that the Asus fits the billquite well. Windows 8.1 took a little bit to sort out but I have a windows phone and I like that it is paired with to lap top. The reason I gave it 4 stars is the case is rather flimsy. You need two hands to open it. I can see why they offer a 1 year warranty for damage,I don't think the case would survive a drop. With that said, all in all for the price I feel that it was a good fit for me.
