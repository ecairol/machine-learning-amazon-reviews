Do not buy
This laptop includes a Dell branded WiFi card (Dell 1560) that simply does not work - can't find WiFi networks, drops the connection, and has extremely poor reception. Dell sent a technician that replaced it with a brand new Dell 1560 branded wifi card (the same model) with the same results. Borrowed an Intel WiFi card from a friend which worked like a charm as soon as I plugged it in. Dell support says they cannot provide a different WiFi card than was provided with the laptop even though it is clearly a substandard card included with what is supposed to be a top of the line premium laptop. Such a shame, good laptop that someone at Dell decided to save a 5-10 dollars on by including the worst wifi card I have seen in years, this coupled with a support organization that is not allowed to fix the problem - do NOT buy.
