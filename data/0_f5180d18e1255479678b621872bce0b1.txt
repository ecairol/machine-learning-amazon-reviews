I bouth this laptop two moths ago. The computer seems to just linger sometimes for a couple of seconds while it "thinks", in the meantime I just have to wait while it does whatever it is trying to fix in the middle of my work. Also the keyboard is really cheap. My Shift key is already busted.Do not buy this laptop for daily work. This is more of a laptop for power point presentations at conferences or such. By they way you will want to do your presentations in your regular work computer because this one will make you lose your mind. Additionally I am always struggling to connect to my home and work wi-fis when none other of my devices have a hardtime at all.
