Definitely Impressed!
First Impression: Impressive packaging! Sleek and very light.Pros so far (Purchased Recently): Very light, It's like adding a notebook to your backpack. Boots up quickly, it's not instant, but it's pretty darn close. Screen resolution is exactly what's advertised, and the keyboard isn't a weakness at all. I'm currently running windows 8.1, since there isn't much of an incentive to upgrade.Cons so far: Touchpad is a bit too sensitive and either too swift or sluggish. It's not that big of a weakness, but a wireless mouse will probably be a fair investment. The laptop is sleek, but the screen doesn't seem as sturdy as one can imagine. Keep in mind, it might be designed that way to have that sleek feeling. Laptop also does look like it'll need to be cautiously moved, and it might be severely damaged if dropped, but hey whichsleek laptop wouldn't?Overall Review: Holy crap, this was not expensive at all for a laptop and it seems to do well so far. 4 stars seems like a fair rating with the only stumbles being the touchpad and screen strength.Would I recommend? : Absolutely! You're getting a great bargain with that price! I've only had it for a couple of days, but I will continuously update this review for possible future buyers.
