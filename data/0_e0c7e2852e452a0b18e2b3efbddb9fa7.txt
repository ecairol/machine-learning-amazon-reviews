The Chromebook OS is awesome. So my review pertains only to this ASUS Chromebook. I had an HP Chromebook that took some heavy use and abuse and lasted for two years with no issues. I LOVED it. It died a sad death, through no fault of its own, and I was in a pinch. So I bought this one since I was low on funds and could not buy an HP Chromebook. Now I wish I had spent the extra money. This thing freezes every two minutes and has to reboot. It does not run as smoothly as the HP version. Spend the extra money and get an HP.
