Very Happy with My Flex 3
I have been using my Flex 3 14 for about a month now and really enjoy the performance.  It boots up quickly and has a reasonable/good battery life.  I use this mostly for MS Office (primarily Excel and Word) and the apps run just fine.  Video playback when looking at web content is crisp.  Browsing the web when I have good internet connection is a breeze.I like that I can use this in tablet mode when the need suits me.  Kinda cool to put it in "present" mode (keyboard facing down and screen towards me) when I am on a plane an watching movies. etc.  The design keeps the keyboard from actual touching the table surface so the keys done get pressed or worn.The design and feel is solid and the keyboard has a great feel.  All in all this a very good if not great convertible laptop.
