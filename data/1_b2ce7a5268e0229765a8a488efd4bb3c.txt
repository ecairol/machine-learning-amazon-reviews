So far so good on this one
So far so good on this one. However this is the second Chromebook sent to me as the first one crashed and I had to return. Amazon sent me a replacement before I even returned my faulty one. The new one however is working as expected. I knew the Chromebook was limited but did not know it does not support Itunes. I am still getting to know it so can not give a better review.
