Awesome office / school PC
I have been using this daily for office / school type work since it was released about 5 months ago.  It is an outstanding device for my needs.  Easily 8-10hr of battery life with constant use.  Streams HD perfectly, and handles all my applications fine.  It is not a CPU powerhouse and imagine would not perform well for gaming or intensive CPU use but its not advertised to be.  Only minor negative would be the weak built in speaker output volume, works great with headphones though.  I would recommend this device to anyone!
