worst speakers I had ever heard
Screen display has issues, display would not show unless it was opened over 90* and then at times would have a black shadow on the right side of the screen. Toshiba's quality has gone way down. Had my last laptop from Toshiba since 2007, thought the quality would be the same, BUT it isn't! I bought a 17" also at the same time as the 15", it is also going back, worst speakers I had ever heard! No volume and very tinny.
