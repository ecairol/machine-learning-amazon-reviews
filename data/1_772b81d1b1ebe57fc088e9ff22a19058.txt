Great value with a decent price.
This laptop has a very sleek and smooth design. I very much enjoy the physical appearance. However, there a few minor flaws that caused me to dock a star.First, the airplane mode button on the laptop is backwards (on mine at least). When the light is on for a certain button, it usually means that that button is currently active. For example, when I press caps lock, the light for caps lock turns on to indicate that it's currently active. However, the key for airplane mode has an active light although it isn't active.Also, the battery life isn't as good as I expected. I can get roughly 4 hours or so when I'm not using any heavy/intensive programs or watching videos. It's decent, but definitely not the best I've seen.Otherwise, this laptop is great in almost all other aspects. There are 3 USB 3.0 ports which come in very handy. I can use my phone charger's adaptive fast charging capability and it's compatible with the laptop. The laptop runs very smooth and just has a nice feel to it in general.
