Worth the money :)
Operating system is Windows 8, which sucked. It is set up for a tablet, if I wanted a tablet, I would have bought one. Also there is no CD drive, my fault, I assumed it had one even though it does not state so. Tithe computer itself is great, battery life is good, it's light but seems sturdy. The touchpad seems very sensitive, but I'm sure there's a way to change that if I look around settings a bit. Definitely a great deal.
