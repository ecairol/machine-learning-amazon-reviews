Very fragile screen
The item was great and worked as expected until the screen broke in less than a year of owning it. I bought this chromebook in January and it is now October and the screen is already broken. It's not cracked, it just glitches out very often. The item is now out of warranty so I am pretty much out of luck. 2 stars because it was useful while it lasts.
