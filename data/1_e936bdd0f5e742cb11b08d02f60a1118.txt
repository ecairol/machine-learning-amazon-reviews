Decent Product, Bad Seller
The hardware is decent for the price but the body of the laptop is build with really cheap plastic and I doubt it will last very long.  The real reason for my bad review is probably more on the fault of the seller than the product, however, mine came with a weird and almost non functioning version of windows 8 with "speed browser" set as the default browser. There was also some arcade software on it that couldn't be uninstalled and caused a popup every 30 seconds. I bought this new so I don't understand why this stuff is on here. The backspace key is also pushed in and barely functions. I decided right from the get go to give up on this windows 8 and was gonna format the hard drive and install windows 7. The configuration was weird and it took me forever and a BIOS update to finally get rid of windows 8. Now that this computer is running Windows 7 professional everythings working good,but I shouldn't have had to waste an entire day fixing a new laptop.
