Tablet or laptop? This would be a great machine if it would decide what it was!
Pros:As you can see from the specifications, it's a fairly powerful machine. It's also a touchscreen, and the fact that it flips over into a tablet is a neat feature. However...Cons:The inner workings of this machine are much too powerful for its packaging, and therein lies the problem. As others have stated, its speed is throttled somewhat, making it rather frustrating to use. It's also quite heavy, making it an impractical tablet, and it gets hot quickly (again - not super convenient for holding on your lap). An SSD would make this MUCH better and faster, even if it meant sacrificing some of the considerable hard drive space.I'm not really sure for what purpose this was designed. While it would be great for watching movies or the like, it's too much of a machine to use as essentially a netbook (not too mention too heavy). That said, it's too slow for the speed of its processor, so it's not a great machine for gaming or for anything powerful. Its weight also makes it impractical for carrying around as a day-to-day laptop (for note taking or the like), and the HDD makes it impractically slow for using as a fast-waking tablet.
