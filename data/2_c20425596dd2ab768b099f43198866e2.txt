this is a nice chromebook.
This is my second chromebook.  It is mostly as expected.  I had troubles getting any wifi connection.  After all the suggested chrome troubleshooting and ISP troubleshooting we decided we needed a new router/modem in our home.  That fixed the problem.  I also have software issues re: videos.  I have to clear my browser cache and reboot every few days in order to get videos to work again.  Not the end of the world, but definitely frustrating.  But other than that, this is a nice chromebook.
