Great for watching movies and browsing the web
Grabbed this while it was on sale for $200.  Great for watching movies and browsing the web.  I've noticed it lags while playing flash games (like the ones on kongregate) which was a bit of a surprise for a newer laptop, but it was $200 so I'm not gonna complain.  Great laptop for basic tasks.
