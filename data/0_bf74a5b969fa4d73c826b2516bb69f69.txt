Died after 1 week use
I just want to say that I really like GTV overall and started with the Logitech Revue. The Revue works but it's too slow and was looking forward to upgrading to a new device. I was excited about the  Pulse when I first got it. I had no issues with setup or connecting WiFi. The pulse was much faster than the Revue and was happy.But I started having some power issues. I don't have a cable box and I'm a cord cutter. After not using the device for a while I found that it would shut itself off. No issue there but then it wouldn't turn back on with the remote. I found that I had to unplug it to get it to turn back on. Not a major problem but an annoyance. Well after 1 week of use I found that the device had turned itself off. But all attempts at turning it back on failed. I unplugged it and back in several times with no luck. I tried different outlets which also didn't work. So it basically died on me. It could be just a defective unit but I have heard of others having the same type if issues. I'm returning mine and waiting to see what newer GTV device come out.
