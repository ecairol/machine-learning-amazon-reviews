ASUS is a HORRIBLE company. Buyer beware
ASUS is a HORRIBLE company. Buyer beware. I bought a tablet, four months it went bad. They gave me the wrong address, told me I was mistaken they would never do that. 400.00 for the piece of junk.They did not fix the problem I had.I tried to send it back, they said sorry the warranty expired, give us money or forget it. NO phone number of the offices at all.READ the HUNDREDS of complaints on their site.
