Do you feel lucky, Punk?
I purchased this Chromebook two weeks ago primarily for surfing the internet.  It works very well, at lightning speed between URL's.  I keep it in sleep mode when not using it, and it is on instantly when I open the lid.It's big drawback is that it won't connect to Google Cloudprint - the only way it can print.  So I have to reconcile myself to just using it to surf the web.  If I find something that needs printing, I'll have to fire up my old notebook and print.  Their Cloudprint is considered a "Beta" version", meaning they don't have the bugs worked-out yet. I haven't decided whether to keep it or not yet....On edit, I still have the Chromebook,  More research has shown that the Cloudprint problem is more pervasive than I thought.  Definatley believe that this is a Cloudprint bug.  Apparently all the brilliant, overpaid minds at Google can't come up with a fix.  Ironically, I can Cloudprint using my old Toshiba Windows laptop running Chrome.  How weird is that?Downgrading to two stars for a computer that just won't support printing...A week later, sound ceased to work. Downgrading to one star.Unfortunately, I've become addicted to the speed of this little thing.  I'm returning it and getting another brand - perhaps a Samsung or Toshiba.  Thank God for Amazons return policy!
