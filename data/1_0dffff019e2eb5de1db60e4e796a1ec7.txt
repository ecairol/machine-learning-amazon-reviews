The laptop was mostly enjoyable and had several features I liked, but since the wi-fi connectibility was virtually worthless beyond 15 or 20 feet, I returned the unit. I did purchase a used Dell xps 13 through Amazon warehouse, at a greater cost, but really love it. It's faster, just as light, much brighter and better looking screen and superior in every way.
