Lenovo Yoga notebook PCs are not durable
If you have to do much travelling, I caution against buying the newer Lenovo notebook PCs. After only one trip, my Lenovo Yoga 3 (touchscreen) cracked. I have been traveling for more than 20 years with notebook computers of all types, from IBM to Acer to Dell to Sony, and this is the first time a screen cracked on me (I did not drop the notebook - it was in a normal carry-on bag during my trip). Now I have to pay about two hundred US dollars to replace the screen. Although the PC was almost brand new, Lenovo scolded me for "breaking the computer." I buy a new computer every year, and I am highly unlikely to buy a Lenovo again, especially after the service experience. Since that time, I have heard from several people in the computer business here in Hong Kong that Lenovo machines, though elegant in design, are not durable and not good for people that have to travel much (planes, trains).
