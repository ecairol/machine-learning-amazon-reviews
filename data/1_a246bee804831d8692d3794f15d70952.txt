Yup, keyboard kinda stinks, but it's a decent laptop
You have the tech specs above, and plenty of folks have commented on the functionality (components/hardware & OS) of this laptop, so I'll spare you this, but wanted to add my $.02:~The complaints about the keyboard are legit: it really does suck. Sometimes you have to hit keys twice to get them to register. Ugh. I don't know if the keys are just too slim/low or what, but it's really a problem. I hate that I have to retype certain things over, and if my palm accidentally grazes the touchpad, I end up somewhere else on the page and need to backtrack. Yeah, User Error, no doubt, but still...we're using this on our laps, and that unstable, squishy surface doesn't lend itself to the utility of this keyboard.~Similarly, the touchpad is kind of a pain to use: I hate it for scrolling, as it takes huge effort to do (why can't they function like a mouse, allowing you to "grab" the scrollbar with a click/release and swipe down, rather than having to keep the touchpad held down?).~The display out of the box has a scratch on the screen, and I'm not sure if I did this or someone in my family, but we're pretty careful with technology, so I'm guessing the thing scratches pretty easily.Other than these peeves, this is a pretty decent laptop, functioning as expected. It'd be nice if didn't come loaded with throwaway apps and came with some useful software, but that's probably too much to ask.
