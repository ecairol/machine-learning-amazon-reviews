Mouse Pad Broke within 4 Months
The Chromebook worked perfectly for 4 months; then, out of the blue, the mouse pad stopped registering clicks (i.e. I press the mouse pad when the cursor is over a button and NOTHING happens) rendering the computer essentially useless. I would not recommend this nor would I purchase it again... .
