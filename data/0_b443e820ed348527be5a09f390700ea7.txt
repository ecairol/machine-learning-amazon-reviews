the search for a new laptop continues...
I bought this sight unseen based on the good reviews.  Opened it up today, set it on my lap and was immediately disappointed.  There is a ridge between the screen and keyboard which creases into my skin.  Not comfortable as a laptop if one has on shorts (and I live in Florida.  We ALWAYS have on shorts)  Also don't like the cord being on the right hand side.  Finally, the battery seemed to heat up right away (again, shorts...)  On the plus side, if you live up North, you might like it.  It's ultra-light, the screen is a good size and keyboard is ok...I guess.  Didn't like the loud tapping sound it made when pressing the mouse.  Of course, very easy return on Amazon. Unfortunately, the search for a new laptop continues.
