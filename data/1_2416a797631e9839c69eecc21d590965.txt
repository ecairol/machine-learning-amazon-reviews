TOP LAPTOP ...!!!
I LOVE MY LENOVO YOGA 2 ... THE SIZE IS GREAT .... I CAN TAKE IT WITH ME EVERYWHERE AND ESPECIALLY TRAVELLING .... AND SO FAR WORKS VERY WELL SO I AM TOTALLY SATISFIED WITH IT ...!!! YOU CAN MANIPULATE IT VERY EASILY AND YOU CAN WORK WITH IT IN ANY WAY YOU WANT ... ON YOUR KNEES, ON A TABLE OR JUST LIKE AN IPAD ... ANYWAY YOU CAN ROTATE IT JUST THE WAY YOU DESIRE AND THE BEST IS TO BE TOUCHSCREEN WHICH IS REALLY AN ADVANTAGE .... THE ONLY THING BOTHERING ME IS ONLY THE POWER BUTTON HIDING ON THE SIDE INSTEAD OF BEING ON THE FRONT AND SOMETIMES NOT HAVING A CD DRIVE INCORPORATED BUT OTHERWISE IT IS A VERY HIGH STANDARD LAPTOP .... I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT AND VERY SATISFIED TO HAVE BOUGHT IT AFTER DOING SO MANY RESEARCHES NOT ONLY ONLINE BUT GOING TO BEST BUY, STAPLES, SEARS ... ETC ...!!! THANK YOU AMAZON TO GIVE ME THAT OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE BOUGHT A GREAT ITEM ...!!!
