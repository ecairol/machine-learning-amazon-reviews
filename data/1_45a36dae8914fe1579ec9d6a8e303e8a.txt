Attractive Unit, but very warm!
This is a very handsome unit, thin and light. Do not get the brown/purple color, but surely is not a deal breaker. I bought it at the Microsoft Store for 599, a very good deal! After spending several days with it, I've decided to return it. Two deal breakers have caused the return, this unit just runs too warm during simple tasks and really heats up when you push the CPU. I don't think the aluminum case helps at all and I thought the M class CPU was intended to run cool. And good god, what is it about Asus and the color rendition on their displays? There is a yellow tint to most images while surfing the net and even shows on my wallpapers. I did everything from adjusting and uninstalling the ridiculous "splendid app" and made several tweaks to the intel HD graphics app. I never could get it right!
