If you are going to use this for Skype/chat, I think you'll be quite happy with this purchase.However, if you are going to use this camera to keep an eye on things, see the following:This camera does record 1080p manually.This camera does NOT record 1080p when motion activated.Numeric resolution choices are not available in Logitech's software when using motion activation.  You can choose from 'lossless' at best, which outputs a 600x800 video - not even 720p.  I'm not sure how they define 'lossless' but it seems like a 1080p camera outputting 600x800 video is losing something.I was unable to get 1080p resolution out of any third party monitoring software (webcamXP, YAWCAM, etc)This camera does NOT take 15 megapixel still photos.15MP stills from a webcam sounds pretty impressive, right? How about 3MP?  Not very exciting, right?This camera is capable of no more than 3MP still captures.  The free software from logitech stretches the captured 3MP photos out to five times their original size.  Despite the claims, software can not create detail where none was captured in the first place.  What you get are very big pictures that look very low-res.Logitech does mention this somewhere in parentheses on their website, but let's be honest:  advertising "15MP" for a 3MP camera is only misleading people by 500%.*It's a good camera depending on your intended use...This thing will work for me, and I've already sent one back, so I'm keeping it - just wanted to make sure these factors are there for people to consider in the future...........................*Margin of error +/- 500%
