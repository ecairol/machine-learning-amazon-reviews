Terms like, "system glitch"
Just don't do it.  Dell customer service is beyond atrocious.  If you have even the tiniest of problems you will enter the vortex of hell that is Dell's excuse for customer service.  Terms like, "system glitch", "issues with all dispatches at exchange", "really sorry for this inconvenience" will be burned into your lexicon.  It's just not worth the risk of having to endure the customer service/warranty service unless you're a serious masochist.
