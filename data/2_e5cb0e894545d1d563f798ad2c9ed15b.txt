After using the UX305 for over a week now, I can say this thing is really nice. The core-m series is more than capable of doing full fledged computer stuff: excel, web browsing, media consumption. I've even played some Dota 2 on it. Only thing is that it's already developed a wear spot on the track pad. At first I thought it was skin oil, but I tried cleaning it with some isopropyl, but the spot is still there.
