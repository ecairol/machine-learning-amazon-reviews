Not happy with this Laptop.
It does not have a CD drive, and that should be stated to let people know. I am having one installed and it is costing me $45 plus labor. I tried to contact Support and the number does not exsist and I just couldn't get help from  ASUS and I do not recomend the Laptop,I would spend the extra money for a better company. It's still in the shop so I can't say how it will work. The manual that came with it was very small and not much help.
