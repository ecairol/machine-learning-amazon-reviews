Amazing deal. Great value.
I needed to get a laptop to use on the road to support my sales effort and after much research I went with this one, purchased online through B&H; in NY. They offered free shipping and a $50 rebate on the Titanium gold model (MFR # UX305FA-RBM1-GD).This machine is sleek. It just looks exotic and sophisticated. It has a beautiful screen and really is very very well built.It is also light. Very light. I pack this ultrabook with all my other documents and information manuals in a leather business tote and forget it's in there. It's probably the lightest item in the tote.I've used both the wireless network connection as well as the included wired connector. Both work well and have supported my use of online apps from google and zoho with no problems.Within a few minutes of unboxing the device I had started to upgrade it to windows 10 and that went without a hitch. The boot-time is so short I think it'll boot before I can count to 10 - before I'd boot and go grab a cup of coffee. Now I grab the coffee and then boot. I use it mainly for MS Office but I also have some of my ham radio apps installed too and I have loaded on Photoshop CS5 which works but which I would not utilise consistently on this platform. My experience overall is very positive. All the regular office apps work perfectly. The ham radio apps: writelog, dx4win and n1mm all work fantastically well - pleasantly surprised.Conclusion: This is a lot of ultrabook for the price. It works well but I would not really try to use for professional video-editing, photo-editing or page-layouts. It presents a very professional look and having hooked up to external monitors I've found it very easy to do with a $7 micro-HDMI cable I purchased with the unit. I also suggest something like the Amazon Basics 13.3in case http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-NC1303152-13-3-Inch-Laptop-Sleeve/dp/B00CD8AF48/ref=pd_sim_147_2?ie=UTF8&refRID;=0VPZ1022E3NHK76ER14D&dpID;=41Iw5pUfTPL&dpSrc;=sims&preST;=_AC_UL160_SR160%2C160_ to keep it clean and protected when not in use. Battery life is also great and I usually leave home with a fully charged unit and between use at the office and on the road over  8-10 hrs I'm still able to use when I return home. It is great bang for the buck and one of the best buys in ultrabooks if you are on a budget.
