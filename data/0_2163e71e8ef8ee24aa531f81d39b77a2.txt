my only bad purchase on Amazon
I am a huge chromebook fan/supporter.My issue with this model that I purchased is that after 93 days of use a number of the keys no longer work/respond. Now I "could" connect a usb or wireless keyboard, but that defeats the reason for having the keyboard/trackpad already on board.And as I am past the 30 days to ship it back or get a refund I am outta luck.My advice, my personal favorite in chromebooks is the HP Chromebook 14-q070, and use the net with speed (4 gb of memory) and NO keyboard issues! My refurb'd HP is a hugely better product at a significant lower price than the ASSUS Chromebook no not a typo:)
