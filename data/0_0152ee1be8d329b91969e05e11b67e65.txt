Has some issues..
Great little device with the 11 hours of battery life and weight... however sometimes while typing it would freeze for 2 or 3 seconds then it will resume with the letters I've typed. It has only been one month but this chromebook has completely frozen on me four times and at those times I couldn't even move my cursor and I would have to manually shut it down.
