Good laptop, its fast
Good laptop, its fast, I was able to play Raimbo Six Siege 6 Beta whith lowest settings at 60fps, Hard Drive is ok, keyboard feels good, the trackpad i have not using it because i bought a wireless mouse at the same time i bought the computer, overall is a great product and is ecelent for traveling and moving around, cloded it is exaclty the same height as a macbook pro 15 , so it is very thin. I would recommend everyone to buy this product, core i5 with 8gb and 256ssd is a great config that you will not get at this price, about the color there have been many questions, the color its like the colour of makeup rubor, but it doesnt look girly at all if you are a man.
