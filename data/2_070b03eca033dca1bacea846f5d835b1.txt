Getting What You Pay For
You get what your pay for on this. It is great for checking email and internet browsing, but the processor is a little slower than I would like. The most aggravating thing is the touchpad is a little unreliable on the "click". Sometimes I click it, but nothing happens. Still for the price it is a pretty good deal.April 14, 2015: UPDATE: I sent the laptop off to ASUS for a trackpad repair. They quickly repaired the trackpad and returned it free of charge (under warranty). It is working well now.
