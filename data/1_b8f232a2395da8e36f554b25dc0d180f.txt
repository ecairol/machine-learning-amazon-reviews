No Trial Microsoft Office Installed/Included!
Unlike most other PCs/Tablets/Notebooks in this price point, this computer did NOT come with a trial version of Microsoft Office (Word/Excel/PowerPoint/Access, etc.). If you buy it, it is $6.99 per month for one computer (or $69.99 for the year - if you pay all-at-once). I would have chosen another computer, had this been clear (my fault; dangerous assumption, I suppose).The chicklet keyboard feels pretty cheap (plastic) and unlike other laptops, you have to hold the function botton down to use volume buttons, brightness buttons, etc. on the top row of keys.One other little annoyance is there is NO USB port on the right side of the computer. If you want to attach an external mouse (if, like me, you are annoyed with the touchpad); you better use a wireless mouse, or the cord must be draped in front (or behind) the whole laptop (for anyone right-handed).
