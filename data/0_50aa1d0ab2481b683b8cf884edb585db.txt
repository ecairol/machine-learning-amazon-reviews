This computer was sold to me with windows 7 istalled and it was built for windows 8. I had the geek squad work on it for 2 days and tthey said that it is awful that omeone would sell someone a new computer in that condition. It came with windows 8.1 disks but the geek squad said if I install it would crash my computer. They said now I have to wait untill windows 10 is released to fix this issue, but only maybe. It will take 5 days in which I have to bring this POS to Best Buy and get the geek sqaud to do a clean windows 10 install. Some of the OS files are missing. Thank God I had the geek support or it would of cost me a arm and a leg. This is an awful situation and experience to go through. If I have to return it will cost me another $90 to transfer the data to anther computer. What a mess I got into. OMG I would like a refund of the $90 I have to spend to transfer the files off this computer
