Smile, smile, smile for Chromebook
I love this thing. I bought a desktop pc and this Chromebook to replace my one and only computing unit: an aged Acer laptop. It's a joy not waiting for it to boot up like I did with my laptop (about 6 seconds now). No more opening task manager to close unneeded software, no uninstalling more software to make it speed up, etc. My phone is an Android and everything is synced through my Google account, so I get the same notifications on my Chromebook if I don't have my phone near me. Not only is the Chromebook "light" software-wise (Chrome OS is simple to use), it is physically as well. I take it with me to my part-time job at a college for student help and it's wonderful not getting locked screens, or waiting an eternity for a website to load. Wireless is pretty much everywhere, so it's not really a problem using the Cloud for storage. This is a beaut.
