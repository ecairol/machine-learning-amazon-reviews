Flexible budget laptop!!
This has been the best purchase i've made so far with a laptop. I got a great deal on it. I never assumed that for that amount I can get such a good machine. The display is amazing; no matter what angle i look at it it's still very clear. It's a beautiful little laptop that can do many things. I love that it maneuvers into different angles and turns into a tablet and tent mode. Battery life is very good on this; I get about 8 hrs on power saver and that's while watching movies the entire time. It's very easy to use in tablet mode because the touchscreen helps out a lot. The keyboard feels a little bit cheap (flimsy), but it works great. I would highly recommend getting this laptop if you're on a budget and even if you're not it's still a great purchase.
