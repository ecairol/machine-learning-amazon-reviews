Great notebook.
It's a great notebook.Finally, we don't need buy a Macbook and install Windows on it.The keyboard is good enough, at least better than latest Macbook 12. The battery is good too, most of the time I use it without connecting to the cable.Anyway, the trackpad is still not good enough compared to Macbook. I don't know whether it is software or hardware issue. Sometimes if I am pressing Ctrl key while scrolling with two fingers, Chrome browser will zoom in and out rapidly... which is quite annoying.
