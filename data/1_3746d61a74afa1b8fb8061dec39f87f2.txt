Very good Chromebook for the price
Very good Chromebook for the price! Just make sure you buy the one with 4gb because it's faster. The display is ok but not a 1080p IPS like the Toshiba Chromebook 2 but for watching videos it does the job. There really is nothing bad that I have to say about this Chromebook, it's very light and the build quality is great. I've owned several Chromebooks and for the budget minded this one is the best, but, if you do have the money go for the 2015 Toshiba Chromebook 2 1080p IPS model because it's even better and now comes with the backlit keyboard. Hope this helps any one looking into a Chromebook.
