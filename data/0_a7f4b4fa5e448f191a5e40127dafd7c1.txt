Not the Best Laptop I've Seen
This laptop isn't the best laptop I've seen. The only CON that really bothers me is the mousepad. It's usable, but it's not something I'll use. Instead, I'll be switching to my gaming mouse which is more convenient and responsive. The resolution and other graphics related things are pretty good. I'm truly satisfied with that; however, the storage capacity is interesting divided between OS (C drive) and Data (D drive). Either way, 256 gb seems like a small amount of storage, but that can be resolved with an external hard drive, storage clouds, or other thumb drives. The other CON is that when I right click on icons in the windows bar on the bottom, the display menu  (unpin or pin this program...close program...etc) comes up weird--weird as in incompatible or messed up. The sound is great. I still don't know where it comes from, but it's pretty decent. Another CON about this computer is that it has a somewhat "loud" fan that turns on for like heavy programs or updates. Overall, it seems good, but definitely far from perfect.CON:Touchpad is less responsive and sometimes annoying.Small storage (256 gb)Sometimes fan can get somewhat loudWeird incompatibilities with the operating system (nothing major though--only random small things like menus etc.)UPDATE (8/20/15)I've decided to return the laptop. The fan noise got to a high pitch state that bothers me. The SSD has issues transferring files to USB sometimes and lags/freezes completely. However, I must say the graphics and screen display is pretty nice. I just wish the rest of the hardware was just as good.
