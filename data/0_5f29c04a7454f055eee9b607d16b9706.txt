Junt at best!
One star is much to high a rating. This is the most worthless piece of junk I ever saw. The Windows 7 pro is why I bought it and when it starts up everything was familiar from my Win 7. Went south from there. I was going to throw it in the garbage, wasn't worth the price of shipping it back. But ended up giving it to my son, he wants to fool with it. This computer has assured I'll never consider Lenova again!
