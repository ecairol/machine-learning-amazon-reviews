Really good value but some significant shortcomings from Amazon and Asus
My girlfriend and I decided to be cute and get the same laptop. But I am poor so I bought a Like-New condition to save some money because the description said that it is all in original packaging. The laptop came extremely dirty and had scratches all over it. I do not know who amazon-certified inspector that "certified" this laptop but the condition is less than good and definitely not "like-new" which cost a lot more than "good".I did however get to use my girlfriends laptop and for the price you are paying it is an incredibly good laptop. So if you are used to a 15.6" Toshiba Satellite with a bigass speaker then you will notice that this Bang and Olufsen is not quite as loud but the sound was clear. If you compare this zenbook to a macbook air, you will notice that the zenbook is a relatively high and thickness as compared to the mac which tapers down sharply. Also if you are used to the sensitive keys of a mac keyboard, you will not like the zenbook's keyboard as it misses keys that I know that I pressed. I sit here typing on my macbook air so that tells you what I choose in the end. Overall the specs are twice as good as the air but the keyboard plus amazon selling me a fair condition laptop verses the like-new brings the review down. Not a deal breaker but no backlit keyboard for those of you who like that feature. You need to pay like $100 more for the higher end zenbook for that. To Amazon's credit, they are offering me a full refund.
