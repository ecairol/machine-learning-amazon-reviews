UNBELIEVABLE bloatware!!!  Was about to throw this in the trash, had to get a lot of support on the internet to re-set to manufacturer settings, and still, even after tons of updates and driver updates and even getting Symantics own drivers for the touchpad, I can't get it to scroll.  I'm posting this from a Chromebook until I get the patience to work on the Toshiba again.
