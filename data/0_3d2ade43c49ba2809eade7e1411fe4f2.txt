It worked great until the hardware gave up the ghost (mouse/touch pad not working), i was able to watch you-tube, play java based games, print documents to my wireless printer, worked on images, my daughter used it for her school work. It worked so great my PC friends who seem to always get viruses i suggested they buy one.Thirty eight days the hardware let me down the mouse/touch pad stopped working, i just did a RMA to return it to ASUS, now i'll get a chance to see how there support is. hardware suspect, software was great. Great battery life, non standard power plug, No viruses, no slow down, i was able to do 95% of everything i would normally do on my desktop.
