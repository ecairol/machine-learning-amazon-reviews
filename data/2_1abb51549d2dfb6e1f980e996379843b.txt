but with great battery life
I finally found the chromebook I was looking for.  I wanted one as light as possible, but with great battery life.  I knew it would be slower than most other chromebooks, but its actually pretty good.  I use my chromebook more as a tablet replacement than a laptop.  The only time I have a problem is when I go to a weather website because of all the advertisements, but a click for flash video extension helps with that.  For speed go with the C720.  I don't know why, but with this chromebook I've had problems running out of memory and having to uninstall extensions, but I never had that problem with my acer c720 and the same extensions.  The acer chromebook 11 is a good compromise for processing power, weight, and battery life, but its screen is pretty bad even compared to the acer c720 and this asus chromebook.  The matte plastic on the acer 11 makes the screen always look foggy.  The asus has a glossy screen which a lot of people don't like, but at this price range I think is better even if you have to deal with some glare.  I don't understand why asus used a power connection so similar to a micro usb connection.  Why not just use a micro usb connection?  At least the power block is light and very similar to my old nexus 7 power block minus the micro usb.  I wasn't too keen on the micro sd at first, but at least I can keep it there because it goes in completely unlike the full size SD slots on acer's chromebooks.  The thing I would most want to change is having usb 3.0 to make transferring videos quicker.  This is my favorite chromebook so far.  The hp chromebook 11 was light and had a great screen, but needed more battery life.  The toshiba chromebook 2 1080p is pretty nice, but 1920x1080 resolution makes things too small.  You can decrease the resolution, but then why did you buy it.  I also prefer the 11.6" size for a chromebook.  The samsung chromebook has a silver vinyl leatherette cover, so...just no.  This one is just about right.
