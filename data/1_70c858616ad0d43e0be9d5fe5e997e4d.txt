BEST  LAPTOP EVER !
My 'ZENBOOK' IS 3+ yrs old.  I bought it for my ventures out to a SBUX or wherever.  It has been EXCELLENT.  Never even a 'hiccup' .+ ...Because of it's SIZE...it is 2+ inches SMALLER than your basic small Laptop..It is even EASIER to carry around.It DOES NOT have a DVD/CD 'Slot'...& I don't 'miss' that.I will definitely be looking @ a NEW one, when Windows 10 is released.  Loooving this guy...
