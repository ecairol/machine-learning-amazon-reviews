Easy start-up with a prior Google mail account.
My HP Chromebook died after only 7 months, so I got this to give me compute power "in the interim" (i.e., until I could study up on what to replace it with.  This works like I would expect, allows me not to have to worry about software updates  and, now that I finally got a printer which has a downloadable Google drive print capability, I'm back in business.  Maybe not quite as quick as the first Chromebook was, but you can't beat it for the price.  (And you wouldn't probably buy a Chromebook if speed were high on your lise, right?  The "blue" is actually turquoise, but oh, well....  And the best part is that, since I had a Google account, mail, et al before, there is no start-up involved;  all your passwords, contact info, etc., is there waiting for you when you plug in.
