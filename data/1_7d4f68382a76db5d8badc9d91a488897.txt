Great for the price but kind of glitchy
Pros: Touchscreen is very useful as a laptop, tablet mode is also pretty useful, device looks great and has a solid metal feel to it, web browsing is easy, GREAT BATTERY LIFE, decent processing speedCons: kind of glitchy going from laptop to tablet mode (screen has trouble recognizing what direction to turn, takes a long time to shut off the keyboard sometimes), the celeron processor is too under-powered to run major programs like games, ableton/FL studio, or Sony vega (spend the extra money get the i7 8gig version), the mouse pad sucks, windows 8 requires some app trimming for the computer to run smoothlyBottom Line: I highly recommend this device. The price makes all the small issues worth it, but that being said go with the i7 processor.
