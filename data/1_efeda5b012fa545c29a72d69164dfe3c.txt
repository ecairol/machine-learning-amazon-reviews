who know's if I would have actually liked this purchase
I wish chrome book's would set up to VPN's and remote desktop applications without the Chrome desktop application. I sold the chromebook to a friend shortly after a friend due to this flaw. Otherwise, who know's if I would have actually liked this purchase.
