Read most of the reviews on here while I was waiting for this laptop.  I received mine last night and I love it.  Its everything I imagined it to be plus more.  If you are thinking about getting this model, do it!  The track-pad to me has no issues, as well as the keyboard.  The keyboard to me is identical to Mac laptops somewhat.  Only thing that this laptop is missing is the light under the keyboard so that you are able to see the letters at night.  But that is no big deal.  Its very fast and responsive.  I did not notice any screen flickering as some reviews mentioned. At least not yet, will update my review after few months of use if i notice any change.  -i5 model 256 SSD
