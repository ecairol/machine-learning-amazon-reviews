I got a refund
Really wanted to love it. The build is great. The screen is washed out and not pleasant to look at. Battery life was great. Also had intermittent issues with wifi. Speakers were also very quite.Basically my first gen toshiba chromebook beat it in every way besides build quality.It went back for a refund.
