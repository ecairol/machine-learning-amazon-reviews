Smug Satisfaction
I've had this laptop for about a month now and I don't have any complaints. It more than fulfills my needs as a student. Here are a few observations and concerns I had:A. If I want to play League of Legends, how will it run? It runs well but I only use the lowest settings, going higher tends to make the laptop run hot. I run google play, skype, and lowest League all at the same time an it runs flawlessly.B. Since there are no moving parts (cooling fans), is heat management effective? The laptop runs hot under intensive use above the keyboard. I'm not sure what effects this will have on long term wear and tear. It doesnt really bother me.My only recommendation is that you use pcdecrapifier, CC cleaner and nnite (google these) to get rid of bloatware and optimize your computer.So far, I love it. When I see people having trouble with their $1000 mac books and bulky Dells, it brings me plenty of smug satisfaction that I made a better choice. Seriously, the generous SSD and 8GB RAM is life changing. Battery life is ok to be perfectly honest, but I havent had any problems with it. If I run it on one of the "balanced" power plans and dont do crazy intensive stuff it'll last all day easy.
