Logitech C920
I posted pictures up on this product on Amazon. Feel free to take a look.I am a long time fan of Logitech for years. In my household, we have well over 15 items of nothing but Logitech products. This webcam is extraordinary.The graphics quality is exactly what it says. It is 1080p when I am using it on Skype 5.8. Movements are smooth. It even follows me across the room and seems to go around corners too to keep a close up on me while I am on Skype chat so my friends and family can still see me up close and personal.The fact that many products are coming out with 3.0 gives this a major edge against the C910 which say recommended 2.0 so I take it that is as far as it will go. 3.0 speed  for USB is a great asset to have on this cam.This cam is small,compact but it's dynamite in a small package with too many features to list.Feel free to do a spec comparison between the C910 to the C920 on the Logitech site with tabs side by side. There is quite a few differences and for roughly what I seen on Amazon for $5 more you might as well buy the C920 instead of the C910 that comes with quite a bit more features compared to the C910.The dealer I bought it from here on Amazon was also very speedy on giving me a quick delivery of this product to my house with no hassles and his prices are reasonable!LOL I would recommend this to anyone.
