Works well has a great battery life
Works well has a great battery life. I am new to the Chromebook operating system so it is taking some getting used to. Everything is saved to the cloud and you have very few apps. This was purchased for my father in law to surf the web and for that it works fine. We had to buy him a new wireless printer that supports "e print" cons are no disk drive, unfamiliar interface, does not work with traditional printer. Pros fairly easy to use, good for web browsing, lightweight, great battery life.
