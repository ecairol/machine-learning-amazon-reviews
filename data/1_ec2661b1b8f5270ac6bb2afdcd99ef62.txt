Very satisfied with the performance of this Zenbook
I've been working on it for the last 3 months now. The first thing I did before using it was to wipe out Windows, and install Ubuntu 14.04, which works quite well apart from slight glitches like brightness controls etc, which can be easily fixed with suggestions from Ubuntu forums.It's very light, sleek and professional looking, with a good size keyboard. It's easy portability more than makes up for the 4 hour battery life. There are no fans, so it's not noisy. It came with an ethernet to USB cable and adapter.
