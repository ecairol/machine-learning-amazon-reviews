Great for the casual user.
Really great for the everyday user. For people who browse the web, use social media, type word documents. This computer was not made for high performance gaming, high graphic applications, movie and picture editing. It will stutter and crash. This computer was made for CASUAL users, and should be fine for what most people use computers for browsing the web, MS office, iTunes, etc.
