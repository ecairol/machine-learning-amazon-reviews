I've love most Chromebooks, but this one is GARBAGE.
I'm a big fan of chrome books and boxes.  We have two chrome boxes and 2 laptops.  The first was the Samsung 550c which is what I'm writing this review on.  It's several years old now, the kids have dropped it and the case is cracked and keys are missing, but it still runs FAST.So I bought this Asus expecting similar performing results.  This device is total garbage.  Loading webpages is very spotty.  Sometimes its quick like the 550c but other times it just spins and spins.  I put the 2 side by side and loaded webpages (connected to the same wireless router) and the 550c outperforms this Asus every time.  I'm not even sure what to do with it, I feel guilty selling such a piece of trash and I can't return it.
