Faulty product with bad customer support
I purchased the Hisense pulse about six months ago and wish I had purchased another device. The Pulse worked OK for about a month but then it started to crash and lockup on a consistent basis. The only way to resolve the issue it to unplug it and then plug it back in. Worse then the constant crashing is the poorly manufactured remote control. The remote broke after about 3 months of use. The keyboard and tophalf of the backside would not control the Pulse. There are no aftermarket remotes to replace the Pulse controller, so I contacted Hisense to get a replacement. After emailing and calling back and forth a bit, they told me to send back my broken remote and they would send a replacement. I sent the the broken remote back three weeks ago and still have not received a replacement. I have sent emails to my contact at Hisense but she has not responded. The broken remote was at least able to turn the device on and off, I was then able to use the iphone app to control the device. The iphone app itself barely works and often disconnects from the pulse, it is not a selling point. Now that I have no Pulse remote I have to turn the device on and off by unplugging it. If you think you can leave the pulse on all the time, forget it, it overheats and crashes. Google has provided little support to the GoogleTV platform and now has some stick thing. Don't waste money on this device.
