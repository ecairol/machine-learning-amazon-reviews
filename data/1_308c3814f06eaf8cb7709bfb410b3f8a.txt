Had to have it delivered 3 times.
TV was delivered 2x with screen problems - first screen was BROKEN with visible cracks, 2nd screen the edge housing was cracked, and caused lines to appear across the screen.The THIRD time it was delivered, the same edge was cracked or aberrated, but it didn't affect the screen quality so I accepted it. It was either that or wait yet another week for another broken TV.I don't know why this TV has so many broken ones. They shouldn't leave the shipping area with these defects/cracks.
