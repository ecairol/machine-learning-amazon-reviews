Great Value: Great performance
Hi all,Don't normally post reviews and there are already many great/accurate reviews of this product, but I wanted to echo those reviews with my own thoughts. I am a college student who uses my laptop primarily for research, online collaboration (google docs/etc), streaming media, and Microsoft Office.I was really trying to find the best bang for my buck when buying a laptop this time around, thus I bought this Zenbook. I have only had it a few days so far, but I couldn't be happier with my purchase.I think ASUS really put quality inputs in this machine where it matters and kept costs down by passing on the "flashy" bonuses of many high end laptops (i.e. backlit keyboard, touchscreen, etc.). Originally I was concerned that the core M processor may be a little slow, but I must say the Zenbook has performed great for my expectations. Between the core M, 8 gigs of RAM, and the SSD the laptop runs quickly.As many others have pointed out the trackpad is very loud haha. Based on reviews I knew it'd be loud, but it was even louder than I thought. This is not a big deal to me, but it could affect your purchasing decision based on your preferences.My final recommendation is to buy this laptop if you are looking for a value packed machine that can perform the typical tasks of a professional/college student/average laptop user. If you are a power user of any kind I would imagine you would benefit from a more expensive machine with a little more meat to it, but for the price this Zenbook is tough to beat.One last recommendation. Go buy this on the Microsoft online store. There is currently a 100 dollar instant rebate. If that instant rebate is gone you can still use the "education discount" to get 10% off.
