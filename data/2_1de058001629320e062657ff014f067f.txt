Best ultrabook for the money
A Great Ultra book, super fast literally boots in 5 seconds, I had my doubts on the core M but can handle most things with ease,handles even streaming 1080p movies with ease so don't let the slow cpu speed turn you away, most laptop cpu's are overkill anyways. Reviews say it runs hot and has glitchy touch pad deff not the case in my opinion , the touch pad is just very responsive.the laptop Itself runs super quiet no noise at all doesn't even seem likes it on or running, solid build quality all aluminum case is really nice. The display doesn't wobble or anything like most displays do and the ips display is great. If you need just something to do web browsing,watch movies and do things like word,excel and access then this is for you. Some reviews say the wifi is slow and it was at first but after installing new drivers it got faster, which you should install the lastest drivers anyway when buying a new laptop. Chrome opens up faster than you can blink. Gaming wise it's deff not for that idk why you would wanna game on a fan-less 13 inch ultrabook anyway. Windows offers the same model it's just called ux305fa-usm1 same thing just doesn't come with all the bloatware and third party apps new laptops usually come with, which is the one i purchased. Battery life is about 6 hours on high performance power mode and 10 hours on power save depending on what your doing. The keyboard is solid myself personally i like the spaced out keys and don't care for the lack of a backlit, there are things called lamps. Overall you can't beat the price, at least not right now closest one is the dell xps13 for 200 bucks more. There's no perfect laptop out there but this one is pretty close.
