Works with Mac OSX
Despite what the product description states, just want to let all other Mac owners know that this webcam does work with OSX. Plugged in the webcam into a free USB port and it showed up as a selectable option in the dropdown list of my webcam software - I use ooVoo, have not tried any other software such as Skype, etc. but chances are that it will work just fine.Although I have not confirmed it myself, but is the likely situation, the included Logitech software is probably for "add-in" functionality such as avatars, overlays, etc that can be used while using the webcam. There is no driver to install on OSX for this webcam to operate, it is functional out of the box. However, I have not checked whether there are certain resolutions which are not supported because of a lack of specific Logitech software or drivers for Mac.One thing I did note on my MBA (13" / 128GB SSD / Core i5 / 4GB RAM / Lion) is that the fan does turn on when using this webcam vs not when using the built-in iSight camera. Hope this helps all of you Mac owners wondering if you should by this cam.
