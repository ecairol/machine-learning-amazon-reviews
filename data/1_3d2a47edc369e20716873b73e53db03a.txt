This is exactly what I was looking for in a light, thin laptop. The only issue I experienced, which seems common among reviewers, is the touchpad. Holy cow that thing is super annoying. Almost so annoying that I considered returning this, but then decided to just get a basic wireless mouse. Now the computer works great,  super easy setup, really lightweight. Definitely buy a wireless mouse if you're buying this laptop, or else you might pull your hair out.
