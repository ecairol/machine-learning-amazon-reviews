- Good for school
Pros:- Good for school; basic laptop- Fairly durable, I've had this over 2 years and its going strong- Less than half the price of an apple/mac computer- Same price as chromebook (because laptops allow you to save to your desktop, they are better in many respects)- Great for spacey people who drop their laptops every couple years (ah hem, that's me -- now, I upload to various clouds and don't worry about commuting this thing around -- less stress)Cons- Keyboard and mouse pad are louder than other laptops- Boring design -- you get what you pay for- Windows 8 (you can get rid of it; I just got use to it)- You can't load some high-tech games; but if you were that kind of person, you wouldn't be reading this now would you?
