Mousepad useless after 3 MONTHS
I like the speed and the somewhat quietness of the system. Only downside is my mouse pad already gave up on me after just three months of using. I mean how is that possible. Hopefully nothing else gives out later one. And the SONIC MASTER speakers are disappointing too.
