Receive a used one when pay for new
Bought iPad air 128GB. Needed in a hurry so pay for one day shipping. I do a lot of online trading s I need something fast n reliable. My iPad 3rd generation seem to required charging all the time and loading seem to slow down.love the new iPad air. Fast ,sleek, love every thing about it. After set up and download and update all my apps I start using the search engine and look at the history that's when I realize that this iPad has been used. The history list was long. I'll be contacting amazon today to return this and get a new one. Good luck to all.
