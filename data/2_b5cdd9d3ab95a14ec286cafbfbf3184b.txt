Totally Blown Away!!!
After trying out two high-end Ultrabooks and countless hours of researching Chome OS and comparing it with other "lower" end Windows laptops, I decided to take the plunge - and I am honestly blown away. I have yet to encounter a single site or app that will not play in Chrome OS - including Amazon Prime (which has smooth video playback) and even Pogo (in spite of previous blogs and complaints across the web of incompatibility). Evidently the folks at EA have taken note, as have others, or the next great and upcoming wave to replace bulky, sluggish, battery-draining laptops.My main draw was looking for a lightweight and portable "laptop" I could use for school, without adding 5 pounds to an already-loaded backpack. Also, the 9.5-10.5 hour battery life seems legit - with 84% (9:44) of batter remaining after nearly three hours of web browsing and Plex movie watching (yes, the Plex app runs flawlessly - even with Subs).Though I will not argue of the need for a Windows device for software like Photoshop or memory-intensive DAW music production (for which I have a high-end desktop PC), as that is not the need for this Chromebook, I cannot say that I miss the functionality.I haven't noticed any sluggishness as of yet, though that is not my intent. I am simply using it as I normally use a PC or laptop, and thus far, I am undeniably impressed - especially for a Celeron processor. Also, the keyboard is phenomenal, the touchpad is the best quality and sensitivity I have ever had the pleasure of using, and the bright 720p screen leaves little to be desired (other than the minor viewing angle adjustments here and there). The size is just right - not too big, but just large enough to accommodate the incredibly accurate and comfortable chicklet keyboard.Though I felt I was taking a gamble plunging into Chrome OS with so many unanswered questions, let me just say one thing - I have found my new laptop (no, not my 2nd, but my primary) and I am sure it will keep me satisfied for many years to come!
