This is a great laptop! Why
This is a great laptop!  Why?1.  The thirteen inch HD display is a pleasure to look at.  A resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels means that everything is very sharp but text is still quite readable at a typical distance of 12 to 18 inches.  Yes whites are a little yellow but unless you are comparing side by side with a cooler display you will not even notice the warmer white of the Zenbook.2.  No cooling fan is required because the electronics creates much less heat due to the new M chip set.  So no fan noise - and the bottom of the laptop barely gets warm.3.  The keyboard is very good!  Unfortunately, it is not back-lit in the lowest cost version and there are many times when I wish it were.4.  The touch pad seems fine to me.  I have reduced its responsiveness to decrease accidental activations when I'm typing.5.  The Zenbook only weighs 2.6 lbs which makes it very convenient to carry.6.  I use Lightroom and Photoshop and both seem very responsive to me.  This low cost version of the Zenbook comes with 256 GB of solid state memory and 8 GB of ram.  Other ultra-lite laptops charge hundreds of dollars more for these features.I am very happy with this purchase !
