Unlucky
I have never written a one-star review before but this Chromebook is a lemon.  Ironic, since I bought the yellow one.  The upper-right screen gets hot enough to burn, the touchpad won't click without a lot of force, and now it stopped charging after a month's or occasional use.  We have an HP Chromebook that we've had for over a year with no issues at all.  I will never buy an ASUS again!  Now have to try to return it....so frustrating.  Don't Buy!!!!!
