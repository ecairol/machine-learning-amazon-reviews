it's a lot better than a chromebook
(i might upgrade this review as i get more familiar with windows 8.1)if you get this laptop for less than $230, then it's a pretty great deal. i've upgraded from a samsung google chromebook. the latter is slowly dying after a couple years. plus, i want to get rid of my ancient desktop that barely works and runs defunct XP. would get a better chromebook, but need the windows OS, mainly for my son when he visits--he doesn't travel with his laptop and has to have access to iTunes and other music related sites. for myself, i mainly use social media, shop, pay bills, watch movies and tv. so, pretty light use. this machine seems fine for all that. plus, the price was right.what i dislike, along with many others, is windows 8.1. i'm using desktop mode. suits me better. still finding my way around. think it's the combination of windows and a new machine. miss having a simple start menu. that said, the setup was pretty easy and quick.plastic cover is is pebbled--no fingerprints! big plus. moving up from an 11" screen to the 15.6" is great. anything bigger and the laptop would be too heavy. it's not light, but still comfortable to sit with it on your lap.comes with a year's worth of accidental damage coverage--nice.i would not have bought this if it hadn't been under $240. don't pay more.
