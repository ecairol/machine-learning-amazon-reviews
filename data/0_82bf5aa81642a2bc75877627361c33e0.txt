Worked fine until mid March 2015
BUYER BEWARE...POORLY make piece of junk!  Bought two of these as  Christmas presents in 2014.  One immediately did not play sound through one of the speakers.  So, I requested a replacement.  Amazon promptly supplied a replacement.  Received it mid January 2015.  Worked fine until mid March 2015.  Won't charge or turn on at all.  Amazon return policy has expired.  Its like they build this just long enough to get past the return policy date.  My other one is having issues as well...probably won't last another month.
