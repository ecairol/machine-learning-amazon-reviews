Don't fall for the promised Google Drive space.
Chromebook is nice, false promotions are not. It is shady how they falsely promote 100 gig free google drive storage.After finding out this Brand New Asus chromebook couldn't redeem the promised google drive space, I contacted their customer service.Did everything customer service email reply told me to do, but still no 100 gig google drive space as promised.Unlike, Google which is so hard up to promote the 100 gig drive space and not deliver, I will go ahead and pay the silly 1.99 myself.
