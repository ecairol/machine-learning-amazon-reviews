Beautifully thin outside, slightly ugly on the inside.
Loved the design and how thin and light it is.  It performs amazingly well for the CPU in it on all fronts, including 1080p Youtube videos.  However, this unit didn't make it past 2 days before I found a quality control issue unfortunately.  The Micro-HDMI out the side did not work and after wiggling ever so slightly I was able to get it to work.  As if this wasn't bad enough, the screen turned permanently purple over all of the text as a result I'm sure of the HDMI issue.I have attempted to change settings to fix this issue, reinstalled the Intel video drivers from Asus' website, and nothing fixed it.  This is not a setting issue but an internal hardware malfunction as you can see in my video.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XoViRPIUqo
