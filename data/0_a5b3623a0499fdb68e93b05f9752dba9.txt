lots of backlight bleed
got me this panel today from best buy, seemed like a good deal got home, fired it up and first thin i noticed is the massive backlight bleed coming from all 4 corners, colors are dull and washed out there is no such thing as black in this panel just gray, very dissapointed im taking it back tomorrow and getting a samsung or LG instead
