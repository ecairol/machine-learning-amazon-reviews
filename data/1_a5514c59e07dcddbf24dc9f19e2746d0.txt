The laptop has worked beautifully so far
The laptop has worked beautifully so far. I changed the hard drive for an ssd and it has met all my expectations. The display is a little bit dim during the day but you need to be out in the open to really notice it.the keyboard has a very nice feeling to it, I really like it.It is not as fast as I expected it to be but has worked well within the limits.The only problem it has shown concerns the display driver, which has given me trouble and I have not yet been able to fix it. The screen suddenly and unadvertenly goes black for a few seconds until a window appears telling me that the display adapter stopped functioning but that it got reinstated.The power button is not very well placed and it is too sensible, many times I have gone into hybernation mode because when I grab the computer from the side, as I try to put it into tablet mode, I press the button accidentally.Battery life is better than I expected. It can go for several hours without needing charge (is it because it is new??? maybe)
