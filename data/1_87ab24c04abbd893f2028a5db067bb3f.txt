Not powerful enough to actually play games (no, Minecraft and Candy Crush don't count) but it comes with the price of a gaming laptop. You're better off getting a surface or something else and saving a few hundred bucks. This laptop gets 30-50 fps on CS:GO and an average of 18 fps on Dark Souls. One reason for this might be the processor speed. 2.2GHz? My desktop CPU from 2010 did 2.9 out of the box. What a joke.Buy a regular laptop for $400-500, or a REAL gaming one for $1000+.Edit: Razer Game Booster helps a TON! If you do end up buying any laptop for gaming, download the software. Dark Souls now gets a stable 45-58 FPS. I imagine CS:GO will be around 60 as well.
