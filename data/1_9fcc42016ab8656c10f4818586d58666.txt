The right click of the Touchpad?
It's awesome and light. I can definitely take it anywhere with me and that's wonderful.The only real problem I have is that when I try to press "caps" (Which I don't think is on the keyboard) I end up just pressing the search button.I'm wondering what are all the shortcuts are.Also can someone explain to me why when I press the right button on the touch pad why it doesn't show the usual options like copy, save as, save picture, refresh/reload etc? I'd really appreciate it
