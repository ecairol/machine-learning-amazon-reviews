An excellent small laptop
I am so happy with my new Yoga 2.  For less than $500 (actually, it cost me only $399 at Best Buy!) I have a computer that performs very well.  Although not super fast, the Yoga 2's speed is pretty decent.  The same with the battery life: it may be unimpressive to some potential buyers (it lasts between five and six hours), especially if they want to use it as a tablet, but it is enough for watching a couple of movies, word processing, and answering emails without recharging.  Its weight and dimensions make the Lenovo Yoga 2 an ideal machine for those on the go, as well as for students and educators.  The Yoga 2 is the best hybrid under $500.  I really love its understated elegance.
