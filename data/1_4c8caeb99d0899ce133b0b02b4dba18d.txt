arrived slightly damaged but great TV
TV set it great but my item arrived with a moderately (noticeable) sized dent in the bottom left corner. The casing is warped and sticking out under the TV. I'm pretty bummed because I don't want to deal with the headache of returning and exchanging but I also don't want my brand new TV to break down on me because I didn't address something that must have happened somewhere along the shipping route.
