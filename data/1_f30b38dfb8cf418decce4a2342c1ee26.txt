Good, but not perfect
PROS: Very fast! I play CS:GO and I have a very nice gaming PC, so I notice when something isn't fast. This laptop definitely is no slouch. It handles CS:GO on low with 60ish fps which is playable. It handles my 20+ tabs and multiple office programs very well. Never skips or stutters.The battery is pretty incredible, to be honest. 10+ hours on every battery so far.The screen is stunning. It gets very bright and it's extremely crisp!The style is great. Very sleek and good looking.CONS: The keyboard. Everyone says that this is a really good laptop keyboard, but if I'm honest, this thing is terrible. It doesn't register half of my key presses and I have to mash every key to get it to work. I don't know if this is just mine, or if it's all of them, but it sucks.It gets really really really hot if you're using it very heavily. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it's hot.The lid isn't very tight. Probably just a problem with mine, but the screen is very loose. It'll fall sometimes without me wanting it to.OVERALL: Would I buy this again? 100%. The value is very good for what you get, even with the terrible keyboard. All of the pros outweigh the one con. People say the WiFi on this thing isn't the best, but I've had zero problems so far. Works just fine. Even on campus with routers not very close at all times.I definitely recommend this laptop!UPDATE:I've had this product for a while now. Still using it daily. However, after using it so much, I've realized that the WiFi card is terrible for gaming. It ping spikes like crazy. For every 5 minutes of playing you're probably standing still for a minute of that time because you can't move from lagging so badly.Also, I'm having track pad issues as well. It moves around but it doesn't click sometimes. So I have to navigate with the keyboard sometimes, but after a while the track pad comes back to life and it's usable.
