Amazing!
In short, I love everything about the Zenbook except the touchpad and lack of keyboard backlighting. I knew it didn't have backlighting going in, but I didn't know the touchpad would be as bad as it is. If you only use a wireless USB mouse, it's a non-issue. The Zenbook still gets 5 stars from me (the touchpad notwithstanding) as it's just an exceptional ultrabook for the price.
