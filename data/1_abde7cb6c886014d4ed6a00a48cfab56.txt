Your Average Budget Laptop.
Really a mediocre laptop. For the price it has great performace, and some great features. However at this price point, you get some poor build quality and the lack of processing power to run more demanding applications. I would recommend looking for some of the other inexpnsive laptops with Solid State storage and/or even Chromebooks if you don't need Windows.
