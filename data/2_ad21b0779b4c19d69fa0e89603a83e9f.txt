Excellent performance | Value for money | No hitches
The machine worked straight out of the box with no issues.Display is great with no coloration issues and matt finish just takes it to another level.Battery performance is quite satisfactory. You can expect 7-8 hours of normal usage (browsing, documents) and 5 hours of movie or rich usage delivery.Touchpad works fine. I don't find the keyboard any awkward. And to those of you who find the placement of 'delete' key awkward, note that it is placed exactly where it is placed in a coveted MacBook Air model. The poweroff key is sufficiently tight for you to not press accidentally and adequately spaced from other keys.Installed Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS and everything worked.Highly recommended purchase if you aren't gaga over a brand.
