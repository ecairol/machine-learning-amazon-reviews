Baller Notebook.
This laptop has everything I need as a student. It runs Windows 10 flawlessly, it has a great 1080p screen, it opens all microsoft office products without hesitation, it has a long battery life, it transports easily, and most importantly- I can run 10 chrome tabs without slowing down. I purchased this laptop for the looks, and it ended up being better than I had anticipated. I thought the processor would be slow, but if you're not rendering or playing games, it doesn't hesitate. The 8gb of ram is quick, and the SSD drive is stellar. It gets a bit warm but I've never been uncomfortable with it in my lap. Also, the keys allow me to breeze through school papers and patient notes.For 700, this laptop doesn't dissapoint.
