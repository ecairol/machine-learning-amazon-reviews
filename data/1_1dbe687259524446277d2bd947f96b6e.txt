It's a sufficient option.
I had to replace my HP Chromebook 14 when it suffered an unknown fatal hardware failure. At only $199 for a 13.3" Chromebook I figured that this Asus would suffice. I like the idea of the Chrome OS and this machine did pick up exactly where the HP left off, but it did have a slight glitch after logging in. It had a screen that seemed to be configuring my new device, but it went on for ever. I eventually forced a reboot and everything came on as expected.Pros: Compact, light weight, cool colors available, battery life is very good, does what I expect of a ChromebookCons: Got hung up on initial boot, keyboard is mushy as the whole thing moves down and up while typing, doesn't connect to wi-fi as well as the HP, occasionally drops wi-fi, high-speed USB recognizes my camera when plugged in then immediately disconnects it resulting in a warning, screen viewing angle and sharpness is mediocre, the 100GB of additional Google Drive storage is a one-time offer and can't be added to an existing account (the work-around is to create a new Google account).I would recommend this to someone who is on a tight budget, mostly needs basic internet access and  doesn't need a powerhouse computer.
