Great Chromebook, though 4GB would be faster than 2GB
Great Chromebook overall but probably go for the 4GB RAM one instead of the 2GB RAM. Ive used 4GB laptops before and 2GB ones, and this one, after a week has show the usual slight slowdown in loading a few things with lots of content on them (long list of emails, sites with GIFs as their backgrounds, some apps on Chrome with multiple tabs in them, say Tweetdeck but with 7 panels constantly loading)), however, the difference is only there if you really load all that media stuff and really for the things that I got this Chromebook for that is not what I do on it.In any event, fantastically light computer that is fast on startup, fast on loading AMZN, websites, and plays videos. I hope it eventually gets MKV support or VLC support, if so it will be the best and lowest cost video viewing machine Ive ever purchased. It would be the ultimate in streaming devices as with its micro HDMI port (I bought a cord for microhdmi to fem HDMI to connect to my tvs 12 ft HDMI cable, only 6 dollar) and fast paced activity with HULU PLUS, youtube, netflix, crunchyroll, funimation, and more and its 10+ hour battery life its great. The sound on the unit is pretty loud, crisp, clear, and powerful. It doesnt rattle or shake on loud volumes either. It also has bluetooth so it can easily hook up to wireless bluetooth soundbars and other bluetooth systems.Anyway, its a great system and wonderful chromebook. I use it more than my larger desktop replacement (which I mainly use for itunes and music). I also love how convenient it is to do presentations on and hook up to projectors via hdmi at work. Its way easier to carry this light unit than larger laptops. Its just so convenient to have it for productivity and bedtime video watching.Minor issue, I wish it had a delete button on the keyboard.
