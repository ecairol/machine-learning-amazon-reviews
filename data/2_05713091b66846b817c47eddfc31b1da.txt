Nice affordable ultraportable but watch out for BIOS update
This is a nice and functional ultraportable for web browsing, microsoft office (not included), streaming video, ...  This is what I bought the laptop for so I am happy.  Have not tried to use the laptop for heavy duty stuff such as gaming, video conversion, ... so can't comment on that.The touchpad driver needs to be updated for gestures to work properly.  Don't know why Asus did not have working driver installed.After I updated the BIOS (210), the laptop could not find a boot drive to boot so it got stuck and bios screen.  Eventually, I found a youtube video "Asus Zenbook UX32A boot fix" and following the instruction to change three boot setting to get the laptop to boot.  This is totally inexcusable.So the hardware is very good but the software is flawed (but easily corrected).
