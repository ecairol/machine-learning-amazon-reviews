Purple Hue, NOT dark gray!
EDIT: I decided to give the Zenbook another try, after all it is an incredible bang for the buck, a lot of laptop for the money. I ordered the 512GB storage model, received it, and yeah i can live with the odd color tone actually sort of liking it now. It is kind of a mix of dark plum, dark gray, a hint of brown; not so much on the lid. Dark keyboard keys. I like this laptop. I like how it came with a C: ("OS") and D: ("DATA") partition of the drive, perfect. Recognized the Gigabyte bluetooth mouse that did not work with my Windows 7 laptop I soon will sell.-------Just returned this laptop after being so disappointed upon opening the box. The laptop's color as seen in product photos misleading, be WARNED! This is not dark gray as some here have said and as the photos of the product show. It has a very prominent violet/purple hue, something I did not want. You can't see the purple in the product photos but trust me you will be shocked at the violet/purple hue upon seeing this laptop visually in person upon opening the box.
