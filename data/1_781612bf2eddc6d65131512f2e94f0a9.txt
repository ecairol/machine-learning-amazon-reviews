DO YOUR RESEARCH!!!
Look, I was just a kid going into my senior year of high school and I wanted a laptop because I felt it would be beneficial and a nice thing just to have going into college the next year. Now, I skimmed through the product specs and compared it with others but since I didn't do any thorough research, I failed to learn that this laptop does not have a dvd/cd drive, so I cannot watch movies or sync any music from a cd. I figured that it was standard since the laptop had a place to put CDs in but apparently it is not. Another thing was that about 4 months after I got it, the internet stopped working. (The internet would start up, but not be able to search anything. some error code). All of the other computers and devices in my house but the laptop didn't. So I ended up having to factory restore the whole thing because nothing else worked.
