Beware correct receipt for rebate
The computer is fine.  Upgraded to Win10, no problem.  Only thing missing, that wouls have been nice, is a slot for a computer lock.One nit to pick - Asus rejected my rebate submission because the amazon.com invoice didn't say "final details."  So I have to resubmit it.  Rebates shouldn't require mail-in paperwork.  They should be automatic with amazon.
