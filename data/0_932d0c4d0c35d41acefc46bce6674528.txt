:(
I got this in October and it is now May and I really want to return it. in the beginning it would cut in and out of internet connection constantly, then it seemed to be more reliable for a while  and now it's back to cutting out for ten minute intervals and crashing unexpectedly constantly. I've done two powerwashes, reset my router, and called ASUS chromebook customer service four different times. after the powerwash the internet seems to work for a little but but I can't just keep resetting the whole thing every time this happens. I really want a refund - ASUS customer service told me I would have to pay $100  to have it sent back because a single key is missing. that's half what I paid for the thing. I want a resolution
