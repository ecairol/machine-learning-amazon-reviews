so far so good
This is our 4th chromebook. Each member of our family has one and out of all of them, this one by far has the best battery life. We also have a samsung, acer and hp. I only charge it at night and use it constantly throughout the day. It also charges soooo fast. If I forget to charge it and it dies (happens alot because I like having it with me) it charges to 100% faster than any of our other chromebooks or our cell phones.My one gripe is that it can glitch on certain websites (usually ones with heavy video content or facebook) and it will freeze for about 10 seconds and then it reloads the pages. It is mildly irritating but for the price and overall functionality I overlook it and still bought this model again for my parents. Time will tell if we get any battery issues like my husbands samsung where the battery is draining faster and faster, but Im happy so far.
