Flawed
Very cheap and soft plastic body. Battery is not acessible from outside, in other words not detachable as most laptop are. This means that changing the battery will require a technician with its accompanying cost of service. The whole laptop is so vulnerable to external shocks and trust me, I have never been so careful with anyother laptop than this, immediately it came out of its box. The specifications are not bad for an average computing requirements. But please think twice before making the purchase because you are likely to go for a refund.
