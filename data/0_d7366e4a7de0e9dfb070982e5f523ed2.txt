TOTAL RIPOFF!!
This has turned out to be rubbish!!!  It was a gift for my son in June.  Almost immediately he had problems with it and had to pay $160 to Tobshiba who promised to fix anything.  HA! HA!  Now he can't even get into his computer at all.  Toshiba says the files are corrupted and they don't want to fix it because they say it's something else.  He doesn't use the computer much and there is nothing unusual to corrupt anything.  It all sounds like a big ripoff to me.  So I've spent this money for a computer thinking it would be a good thing for my son to help him and his 6 year old son, and now he has nothing!!  He has put money into it that he doesn't have to make it work.  So we're both out of pocket here and I am really disappointed and angry.  I don't suppose Amazon will do anything to help.
