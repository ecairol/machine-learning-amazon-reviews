Happy, but not impressed.
Durability and quality have been my largest negatives here. The first one I received had a faulty touch pad and the one that replaced it now has a motherboard error message beeping and for the life of me I cannot locate what the code for the message is, and even if I were able to locate and decipher the messgae, fixing the problem would most likely void the warranty.Such is the problem with devices that have become increasingly inexpensive and smaller. I enjoy this product very much though, simply would highly suggest the added replacement warranty.
