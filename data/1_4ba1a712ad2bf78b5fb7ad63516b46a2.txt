Sleek and stylish
This is a sleek, super lightweight laptop that is very convenient for use around the house, office, or on an airplane.  In fact it's so light and compact that you could even pack it alongside your work computer on business trips.  It looks great too...the ever-growing concentric circles "brushed" onto the top are a nice touch (even as it gets smudged with fingerprints).  The battery life it also more than sufficient, and Windows 8 turns on in a matter of seconds - no more 2 minute start-ups!There's not much negative to be said about the Zenbook by ASUS.  A couple of things:1) The ON/OFF button is right where most users are used to having the "delete" key.  More than once I have put the computer into hibernation mode by accident.2) The reason it is so light and compact: there is no CD/DVD drive.3) The speakers - you'll never want to use them.  Use headphones or send a Bluetooth signal to an external speaker.All in all this is a solid laptop for general use.
