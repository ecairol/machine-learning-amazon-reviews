Screen failed after 3 months, NOT covered by warranty, according to Toshiba
Loved the machine (got it for my daughter) until it was just over three months old. At that time, the screen started to fail, first with a few vertical lines and then more, until the display ultimately died. I sent it to Toshiba for warranty repair, and was just told today that the LCD is broken and is not covered by the limited warranty (although nothing in the warranty itself either excludes or includes the LCD). Apparently, they think that we have damaged it, although the computer was treated well, just like a normal laptop. They now expect me to pay nearly $200 (2/3 the cost of the computer in the first place) to repair the screen. I will never buy Toshiba again.
