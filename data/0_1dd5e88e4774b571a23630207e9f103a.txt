Buyer Beware: Dinosaur in Disguise
I am very disappointed with this laptop. I have bought laptops in this price range before and been very satisfied, but not this time. This thing operates like a dinosaur from the '90s. It takes almost a whole minute to load a page and forget watching videos on YouTube or Netflix unless you set them to the lowest quality (HD? Ha!). It is constantly trying to update programs that I don't even use and the McAfee virus protection program it came with (with a subscription that expired within a week) is the MOST obnoxious thing, popping up constantly. I'm pretty shocked that Lenovo would even sell a computer of this quality. The saying goes "you get what you pay for," but in this case I feel I got much, much less than I paid for. Don't spend $300 for constant frustration. Buy something else.
