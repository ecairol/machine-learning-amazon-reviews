Too slim. Is that even a thing!?
I was searching for a new laptop after my obnoxiously heavy Dell laptop stopped turning on for the second time (after a costly motherboard replacement). After reading favorable reviews for the Zenbook, I took the plunge, excited to make the switch to a much more portable laptop. While the lightweight, streamlined design was initially what attracted me to the Zenbook, I'm starting to think that it's a little TOO lightweight a few weeks into use. The display driver keeps crashing, which triggers my Photoshop to crash. I lost a good amount of work but at least it's teaching me to save obsessively. I also wish there were more ports, or at least it came with more than just a USB-ethernet adapter. A laptop without a CD drive? Seriously? And the ASUS website doesn't carry one either. Sigh. Contemplating returning for a slightly heavier, yet more practical laptop.
