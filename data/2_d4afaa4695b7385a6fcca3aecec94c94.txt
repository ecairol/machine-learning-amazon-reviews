Would readily buy again
UPDATE (4/2015) - Customer service: Had to do 2 separate online chats along with the support phone call as the first person (phone) didn't create an RMA like he was supposed to, the second couldn't find the service ticket and since it was on a weekend had nobody to contact. Third person (via online chat) got it right. The online chat worked great and I found Customer Support easy to reach. After returning the AC adapter (at my cost) it took about 3 weeks to get the replacement. Luckily I had a travel adapter that worked (not all adapters that "fit" will work, check the amp output) so I wasn't out of business waiting on the replacement.Apart from that the laptop continues to perform great.---------------------------------------------------------------------This is an exceptional value. I purchased this for my wife at the same time as components to rebuild my desktop (ASUS motherboard, which is my go-to). Is this as fast as an 8 core CPU with 16GB of DRAM? No. But it does start up (and shut down) remarkably fast for a laptop without a SSD drive. Performance is very acceptable for all our usual activities - browser (email, shopping on Amazon, getting the news,...), YouTube/NetFlix and other assorted videos (just finished the new House of Cards series), even MS Office. I haven't tried Steam games, or any real games for that matter, as I use my desktop for that and my wife doesn't play those. Running Windows 8.1, Norton security suite, some of the misc ASUS utilities and it's just great. No real bloatware on here like with some of the other companies. Only problem has been the AC Adapter - it went bad and wouldn't charge the laptop. That got sent back under warranty (we had to pay the shipping) and we're waiting on the replacement. Did the whole warranty claim via online chat. Another bonus - Best Buy services ASUS (although for whatever reason cannot replace the AC Adapter :-/ ) so you have a local shop to bring it to if necessary.
