I'm in love.
It is such a beautiful computer! The color is almost like a rose gold color in between silver and gold.  The finish of the metal is super smooth and nice too. Keyboard and mouse pad are easy to use.  The setup was painless and windows 10 runs smoothly. I did a lot of research to pick a well priced 13 inch, I looked at comparable Apple computers but ultimately picked this and I seriously can't tell you how happy it made me. And for $699? I don't know but I thought it was a good deal.
