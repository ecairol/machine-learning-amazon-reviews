Nice laptop/tablet combo
This is a very nice little laptop/tablet combo for anyone who needs to do basic, non-resource-intensive computing tasks. I wouldn't recommend this for gaming or graphics design, but for your basic browsing/email etc it's more than fine. The screen flips all the way around to turn the laptop into a tablet (with an onscreen keyboard).Pros - The device is thin but has a nice, solid feel to it - it doesn't feel flimsy. Quality keyboard. VERY impressive battery life.Cons - I found the touchscreen not as responsive as it could be, compared to e.g. an iPad. There's a lot of bloatware you'll want to uninstall.All in all, this has been a nice little backup laptop for me, at a very decent price.
