I Hate It 2
What a time waster! I read and understood the other "I hate it" review, and figured I could tough it out for a nice cheap computer. FORGET ABOUT IT. This computer is horrible. Beside all the bloatware, it is too poorly built and documented. It came with Win8.1 "Recovery" disks and instructions ...but the instructions weren't for this computer. There's a "Novo" button that supposedly lets you reset the boot order ... but it's not where the instructions say it is (not the left side; it's on the right side, inside a tiny hole you need a pin to work) and then the choice of determining what order to boot with isn't straight-forward, and none of the four choices worked for me. No, it wasn't the DVD drive -- this unit doesn't have one; you have to buy one separately -- but mine was working fine. Lenovo's help kicked me back and forth from hardware to software to warranty, but nobody could help. LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE: THIS COMPUTER ISN'T EVEN A DOG. IT'S A DOORSTOP. Sending it back, and thank you, Amazon, for understanding. Now, tell The Happy Face (vendors of the computer) to remove their listing for this terrible computer.
