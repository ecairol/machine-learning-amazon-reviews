Great as a toy... bad keyboard and trackpad may bug you if primary machine
This review is done in the context of this laptop being a toy.  I bought this specifically to load with Ubuntu and mess around.  Its a perfectly adequate machine capable of running any of the software I would run (IDE's, Office, Web browser, productivity).  As a toy, this machine delivers value.**now a more critical review looking at this laptop as a regular daily machine while still keeping its price point in mind.  (things i think even a cheap laptop could have fixed without a great deal of manf expense**Pros:Performancedecent screenLow powerUSB 3 supportHDMI outCons:If you do a lot of typing the keyboard will infuriate you.  The cheap keyboard misstypes constantly.The track pad is terrible.  The location and size will have your cursor constantly push your cursor elsewhere.  Lack of separate buttons (the buttons are part of the main trackpad) makes selecting awkward and difficult.  You will want a mouse to work with this machine.Only two USB ports.
