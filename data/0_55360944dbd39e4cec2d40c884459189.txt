great till it needs repairs
I chose this laptop over many others I was considering because its weight and capabilities seemed just right. It worked great and i loved it for about 6 months. Then someone knocked into my computer bag with a chair, breaking the screen. That should be an easy fix, right? Turns out, no computer repair shops stock Lenovo screens, and they are expensive to order directly from China. The first repair shop I took it to had me pay for the screen (somewhere around $130) which took months to arrive, upon which the screen was apparently "dead". I was refunded my money but still had no working laptop! The next shop I took it to told me the same thing, but that they wouldn't refund my money if they ordered a screen and it didn't work. So now I have a barely used, entirely broken laptop. I will never purchase a Lenovo product again.
