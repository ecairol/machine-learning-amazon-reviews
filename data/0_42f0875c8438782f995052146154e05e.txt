Defective Screen - I was hoping for better
Had it for a little bit over a month and the screen stopped working for no apparent reason; because it is outside amazon's 30 day return window I had to contact ASUS, a company with the worst customer service ever - I have to pay to get the DEFECTIVE product fixed!
