Good Chromebook With Trackpad Issues
On one hand, this Chromebook is a super usable tool. It's affordable and functions just as well on the internet as more expensive PC's and Mac's I've had. For basic internet usage, it's perfect.But there are two problems that drag the score down. First, it does tend to get a bit laggy if you try to do too much (say, have more than 4 or 5 tabs open at a time). But the bigger problem is that the trackpad is very buggy. There are times when it won't move the cursor at all and there are still other times where it will do one-finger commands fine (moving around a page, clicking on links, etc) but not two-finger commands (clicking and dragging). Additionally, the part of the trackpad that I typically click like a mouse is becoming unresponsive.This issue hinders what is otherwise a fine, affordable machine.
