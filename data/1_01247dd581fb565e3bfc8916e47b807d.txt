Disappointing. Afraid issues may emerge long-term.
The delivery: I purchased it on Wednesday using Prime -expecting it on Friday- instead wasn't delivered until Wednesday (Tuesday first attempt).The packaging: The box showed the usual amount of wear that you'd expect - Corners rounded, some sides badly scraped. But I was displeased to find two corners of styrofoams badly damaged to the point where I began to wonder what kind of damage the TV might've incurred during shipping.The packaging II: The screen panel on lower right side had multiple, noticeable scratches. This infuriated me. The panel is the end result of what's inside the TV. No matter how late and superior technology the TV utilizes, if panel is damaged then it's a fail.The performance: This is my first time buying a HDTV that wasn't Samsung or LG. The price to performance ratio may be comparable to former. But Vizio -at least the one I received- is not up to par with them when it comes to performance. It's just not as clear nor brilliant no matter how much I manipulated the settings.The ease of use & innovative feel: There aren't any. The remote is too simplified to have full control of smart TV functions. It even disappoints watching regular on-air television. This TV doesn't offer TV listings like my previous ones did. The only way to know what's on where is to tune-in to each channel and clicking info.Overall, I'm content with what I got, not overly excited nor upset. This was to complete my mini man-cave, and it definitely served that purpose at a reasonable price. I'll also be replacing my current living room TV soon with a 70" 4K TV. It just won't be a Vizio.
