Super light which is great
Runs well. Web browsing is slower than it should be across the board on Chrome, ie, and FireFox. Failed to connect to wi-fi at a few places but works at home. Super light which is great. Charge holds as advertised. Mouse clicking is loud.Updating this review after having this machine for a couple of months. The wifi speed make me want to through this thing at the wall. I replaced my old machine because I was looking for faster processing and web browsing. Runs great hard-lined but they seriously need to come out with a driver update for the wifi card.
