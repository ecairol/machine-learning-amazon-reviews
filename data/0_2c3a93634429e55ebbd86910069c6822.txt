Buyer Beware :/
I bought this computer in November, it was given to a friend as a Christmas gift in December. Barely 3 months after it was first opened the keyboard has stopped working entirely. It started with a few letters not working when you press them, then it became most of them. Thankfully, my friend can buy another keyboard and plug it in. But this should not be a problem on a brand new computer. Very disappointed.
