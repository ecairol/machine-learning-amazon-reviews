Best laptop I've ever owned!!!!
When the Mac Book Air's first came out I instantly fell in love with them. They were so light, so slick looking, and thin enough that you could fit them in a folder! How cool is that? These laptops, I feel, are built just as well as the Mac Books, but are literally half the price. The keyboard is great, the battery life will give you 7-9 hours of web browsing easy, I love that ASUS was able to pack in three usb 3.0 ports. I love having such a thin, light, machine that is still more than powerful enough for running virtual machines. All the hardware is great for the price point, wireless AC, 256gb ssd, etc. Thanks to the AC wireless, and steam in home streaming, I'm able to play games like Crysis, and GTA IV all over campus on a 2.5 lb laptop from my big rig in my dorm room. It's easy enough to open and replace the SSD, wifi card, battery. And there's not even a need to clean the insides because there's no fans! I'll probably never actually have to open it! My biggest issue though, while running CPU intensive tasks and simultaneously charging this thing will get hot to the touch. The CPU doesn't get even close to the shutdown/throttle point, but the bottom of the body will get hot, a cooling pad is recommended. Overall; Love Love Love this laptop!
