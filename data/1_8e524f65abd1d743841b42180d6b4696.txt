Adequate but...
It serves its purpose fairly well. I also really like the design. Very modern. However, the screen frequently freezes for 10 seconds at a time, goes blank for another second, then returns to normal. This usually happens when I have multiple tabs open (maybe around 5 tabs) or when I am loading a video on Facebook. Probably due to the low RAM? But I had a Chromebook prior (HP Chromebook 11) that is about 3 years older and it never had these problems.
