I do not enjoy Windows 8 at all
I do not enjoy Windows 8 at all. I find it difficult to manage my way through all the little apps and windows. They are very slow to load. I have set up Google Chrome so that I can have various tabs open at the same time, but I have problems with that too. If you want to click on the mousepad, it takes quite a bit of pressure, but if you just tap on it, it's extremely sensitive (if that makes sense).I would never order this again. It was just the best price for me at the time.
