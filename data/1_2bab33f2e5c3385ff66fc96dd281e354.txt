Could not be more satisfied
I am a basic type PC user and not close to being an expert. My other laptop is a macbook and my tablet is a kindle. After using this chromebook for a week I am very pleased with this purchase. I've had no trouble doing everything I do on the macbook with the chromebook at a fraction of the price. Both the operating system and the browser work fine for me. I couldn"t justify spending an extra $1000 for a mac again after using this Asus. Maybe a true computer expert will find shortcomings in the chromebook but I have not found any yet. If you are on the fence about trying a chromebook I say go for it. What you get for the price makes this one of the best values in the entire retail world.
