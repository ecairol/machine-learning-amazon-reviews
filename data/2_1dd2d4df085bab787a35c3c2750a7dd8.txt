Best bang for your buck.
For the price, the quality doesn't get any better. I upgraded to windows 10, popped in a 240g ssd, and couldn't be happier (upgrading to ssd is possible with both seagate and WD hdd, but easier and cheaper with the seagate b/c it's a standard sata connection). I bought this as a backup to my macbook pro, but I find myself using this a lot. It's lightweight, portable, and reliable. My only gripes have more to do with Windows rather than the computer itself (god does windows suck). In reviewing the processor for this computer i found that the N3540 out performs the i3 in every category but one. And yet somehow most people were saying the i3 is better. So I decided to do some stress tests in store (best buy) to see for myself. The N3540 in fact outperformed the i3. And considering it was the cheaper of the two, it was a no-brainer. FYI for the engineers, I can run MATLAB, Eclipse, LTspice, Revit, etc, with no lag. And given the ssd upgrade, startup and opening applications is nearly instant.
