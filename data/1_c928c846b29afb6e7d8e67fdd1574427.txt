I love it, except for the Windows 10 upgrade
I love it, except for the Windows 10 upgrade.  It runs very slowly to the point where it's frustrating and difficult to get my work done.  I run a small home business and was hoping this would be exactly what I needed.  From the research I've done, it appears that the Lenova has problems with the Windows 10 OS.  The recommendation is to go into the BIOS and tweak it.  Not for the light-hearted.
