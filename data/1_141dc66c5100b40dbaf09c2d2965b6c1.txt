Very good laptop for the price
This is a very good quality laptop for the price.  I have been using it a lot over the past week and can share the following:Pros:- lightweight and portable- the aluminum case is very appealing and rivals the Mac Pro- the keyboard is well laid out and responsive- performance is great for desktop apps (word processing, software development, web browsing)Cons:- no slot for a tethering cable- not a touch screen (which likely allowed them to go higher end on other components though)- track pad is OK but not as responsive as that on a Mac- screen resolution is good but the 4k models coming out now blow it away for only a little more money- no back lit keyboard
