Not very good
To start with I couldn't get it to register for amazon video. Next came the audio issues with the pass through, it played audio at the right speed (meaning lips matched), but the sound was pitched down too low.  Every so often it would hiccup and but the sound would be still too low.  Now it tells me it cannot connect to the the network.  I've "forgotten" and re-joined the network, turned it off and on, unplugged, everything but factory reset. No dice.  This isn't even including the features like the microphone on the remote that does nothing and the IR blaster that is such short range it's practically useless.I can not recommend this item.
