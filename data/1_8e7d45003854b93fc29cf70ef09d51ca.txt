A nice laptop
The webcam is not good but the laptop works fine for me. I live in DR and I didn't want to carry a expensive laptop with me. The battery duration is fine. Sometimes when the machine is working in multiple tasks I feel the battery life decrease faster, but is ok. I recommend this one for studends.
