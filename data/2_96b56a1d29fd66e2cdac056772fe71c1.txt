Excellent Keyboard.
The HP x360 is hard to beat from a feature set point of view in this price range. Excellent Keyboard.. Great form factor. OK screen..Nice compact keyboard.  Free 1 year office 365. Getting the $25 Microsoft Store Gift certificate is sweat too. and also. Overall I like my purchase.
