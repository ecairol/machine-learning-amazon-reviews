Really nice laptop!
I just got this laptop and not only is the price a fairly good deal and the laptop is amazing. I needed a convenient small laptop for school and college in a year, this laptop is perfect. Its fast, it connects to the internet and functions like any other PC. I really like how it can switch between different laptop, tablet, stand and tent. It makes it convenient to use. The size is also perfect, its not small but not to big!! My Sims games work on it but i wouldn't suggest it for high level gaming. its definetly a nice business and work computer! I highly recommend it.
