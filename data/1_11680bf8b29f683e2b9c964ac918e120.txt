Perfectly Average
It's a perfectly serviceable laptop for what it is. It doesn't do an awesome job running games, but it does okay in a pinch with the graphics turned down. I only play WoW, the Sims, and a few indie Steam games, so that's not too much of a disappointment. Sometimes if I'm streaming video and open more than one or two additional tabs, the video gets choppy or the other tabs run slowly.It is astonishingly light compared to my last (Acer) laptop, and unlike the wiggly charge ports that Acer is notorious for, this one seems like it will hold on tightly for a long time.Windows 8(.1) seems sort of pointless if you're not using a touchscreen. Its aesthetic makes a lot of sense for that purpose, but using a touchpad mouse--it's not really fitting. I deleted the bulk of the preloaded apps as soon as I got it. The color-shifting background is pretty, though.The keyboard is pretty good, just getting used to the new placement of things, but mouse is my least favorite part so far. It seems the buttons are closer to the bottom center of the pad, not closer to the outer edges like I'm used to, so I either have to a) push really hard to click on things (I've never been a tapper), or b) click easily in the middle, but accidentally right-click when I mean to left-click, or vice versa. Also, I cannot stop accidentally zooming in and out on things.In short, it's nothing amazing, but for the $230 I paid for it, it's good enough--and it arrived next day when I used Amazon Prime, so that was a plus!
