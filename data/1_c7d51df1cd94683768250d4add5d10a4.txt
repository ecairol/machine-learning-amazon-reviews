LOVING this laptop
I purchased this laptop for $749.99 but the price went down to $714.99 and again to $699.99 within 8 days. Amazon was great about refunding me the difference in price and I have been using this laptop nonstop since I received it. I was using a 2011 huge 15.6-in Toshiba before this and the difference is amazing.Pros:-lightweight-thin-battery life (doesn't last me 12 hrs every single time, but lasts a good 10 hrs)-matte screen-windows 10!Cons:-keyboard needs to be pressed down a bit more than I'm used to.-doesn't have a home or end button for when scrolling down long pages or documentsSo far, it's been about 2 weeks and I'm loving this laptop. The keyboard "con" I listed above was annoying for the first hour or so but it's so small of an issue that it doesn't affect my opinion about this laptop. It's incredibly fast, light, and long lasting. I will be bringing it overseas on vacation in 3 weeks and hope it keeps performing the way it has.
