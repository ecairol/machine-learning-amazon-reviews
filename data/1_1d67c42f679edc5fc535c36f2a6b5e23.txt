You have to make sacrifices...
Good for the price. One star is gone for not having a usb port on the right side. There are only two (one usb2.0, the other usb3.0) and both of them is on the left side. The other star is gone for not having a dvd when there is space for it, empty. They've just placed a dummy there. I can't believe that the older model of this laptop, with same specs has dvd. Anyway, I replaced the hdd with a 120gb kingston ssd, which I bought for 58$. Installed windows on it, and I don't feel the slowness of the Celeron all that much anymore. The trackpad very uncomfortable, slow and inaccurate. I guess they could have done that better. Overall feel and design of the laptop is ok. Display is what you would expect from a 250$ laptop - standard cheap laptop led. Battery life is normal. I am going to add the dvd drive myself. Oh and by the way, I am a computer engineering student, and this was my gift to my dear beloved one. That's why I am a little harsh on this one.
