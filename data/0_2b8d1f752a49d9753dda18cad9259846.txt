Decent picture, priced fair, but went poop after few weeks.
After reading reviews from Amazon's shoppers, i decided to buy this TV from my local Best Buy. Less than two weeks after bringing it home it started to have problems. At first it would freeze for minutes at a time. Then it was the smart hub that started to not work. No Netflix or any other apps. Then after turning it off to go to bed it refused to come on in the morning. I called Vizio for help. The representative asked to me unplug the cord then push and hold the power button for 30 seconds. It still wouldn't start. I told the representative that I've only been able to use the TV once in the past few weeks. I had missed football games, family movie nights and found it to be crazy that a TV built this days would be having this issues less than a month after paying over $1000. The representative informed me that they will send a tech over to my home sometime in the next week but couldn't give me a specific date or time. I usually buy Samsung tv or LG but wanted to try this Vizio because it was priced right. I now regret my choice and will steer clear from any product made by them.
