Love it besides minor complaints
I bought this laptop after becoming frustrated with my old Lenovo T420's weight, boot-up, and lack of battery life.This Zenbook boots in seconds, weighs half of what the T420 did, and consistently stays alive for 10 hours as advertised between charges.I was worried about the processor, but I haven't had a problem with it in any of my engineering-student related activities after about a month of owning this laptop.I was also worried I wouldn't like the keyboard, but I like it as much as my T420's very different keyboard.Great to find a 256GB SSD at this price.Cons: terrible laptop speakers, pretty bad touch-pad with loud clicks. The one thing I really miss about my T420 are the separate mouse buttons below the touch-pad for left- and right-click. Both the speakers and touch pad are sacrifices I ultimately made for the thin design and low weight.
