Really horrible experience. Second day of use
Really horrible experience. Second day of use, computer stops working: no apps can be opened, settings window hangs there and never loads, internet browser doesn't work; only my documents can be accessed. Have to go through a 3 hour cycle of shutting down and rebooting until the computer finally starts properly. Then the computer works fine for some days, then the problem comes again.Contacted ASUS about it, they told me reset to factory settings. If the computer is new I don't see how that would helpMay be I got unlucky, but I wouldn't take a risk with this. Very disappointed with this purchase.
