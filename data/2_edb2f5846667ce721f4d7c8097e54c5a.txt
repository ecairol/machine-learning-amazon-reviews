Lightweight laptop that is perfect for being on-the-go
I typically like Asus products, and this is no exception. It looks nice, is lightweight, and has a great display. With a 256 GB solid state hard drive and 8 GB of RAM, it is also very responsive, with quick start-up and resume times. Programs load very quickly as well, letting you spend more time doing and less time waiting.There are 3 USB ports and a micro-HDMI port (not the standard size, so you might need a new cable to hook it up to your TV or monitor). While the computer lacks an ethernet jack, it did come with a USB-to-ethernet adapter in the box; you can connect with a wire via this adapter, but you will be using one of the USB ports to do so. There's also an SD card reader, if you are into that kind of thing :)The keyboard and mouse have a good feel to them.On to the bad...at first, the laptop felt slightly flimsy. I think that it was just the light weight and the thin form factor because that impression was fleeting. Also, when you open the lid to about 100 degrees (just past vertical), the lid itself starts to lift the back end of the laptop up off of the table/surface it was resting on; the lid rotates into a position where the back edge of the lid is now resting on the table and the back-bottom of the laptop is now elevated slightly off of the table. This doesn't effect the stability of the laptop at all, but it was off-putting the first several times that I noticed it happening.For the price, you get a fast, responsive, lightweight laptop that occupies very little space in a backpack or bag.
