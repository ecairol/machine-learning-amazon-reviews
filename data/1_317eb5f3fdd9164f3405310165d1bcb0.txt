Rockchip delivers
Overall very happy with the price paid for the ASUS C201 Chromebook (2GB). I was originally concerned about the performance of the Rockchip CPU, but it has so far impressed me. Like others have mentioned, Chromebooks are designed for web based applications, such as Google Docs, and not for native programs or non web-based photo / video editing. I found that it can load most webpages with ease and minimal lag, including Daily Mail & The Verge. On the 2GB model, I could have up to 12 browser tabs open before it came to a crawl. Based on these results, I don't see the need for spending the extra $$ for the 4GB model.PROs:Excellent battery life (10+ hours)Fast boot time, easy to configureGood ergonomic keyboard layout & lightweightBright screenResponsive touch padHDMI, BluetoothCONs:Contrast isn't great, text is easily "washed out" on websites like NY TimesKeyboard is not backlit, difficult to use in dark setting
