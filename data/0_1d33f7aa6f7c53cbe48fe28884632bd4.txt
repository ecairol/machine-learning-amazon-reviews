Holding off judgement.
Light, slim, and fast. It's like having a macbook air at half the cost. So why 3 stars? I have another Asus laptop from a year ago that already has major issues. I've had issues with nexus tablets from them as well. They have quality issues so I'm not giving 5 stars until I know for sure.
