Worked well for 2 months, then died
I liked the computer, it seemed like it performed well for the price. Playing simple games, it will stutter when the memory usage gets high, but it is great for simple things like web browsing, homework, watching movies etc.Sadly, it only lived about 2 months... I was using it in a class, and the battery was really low, so I closed the lid. Later that day I plugged it in and it was totally dead, couldn't even get the bios to show up. No drops, no spills, just died.
