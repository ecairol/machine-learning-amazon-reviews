A little bit surprised and disappointed with it
A little bit surprised and disappointed with it. It is not as user friendly as I'd hoped. Adding desired Apps is also limited to only Google Chrome Apps. However, I like it's included security protection, it's size and portability and it's speed and screen resolution.
