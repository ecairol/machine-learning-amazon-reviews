Extremely slow and unresponsive
The Lenovo Yoga 2 11  is extremely slow.  It is unresponsive to mouse clicks. My biggest mistake was not playing with it enough within the 2 week grace period Best Buy gives you.  I would have returned it in a heartbeat. I hate this computer. I didn't save any money because I had to buy the Geek squad service to help me with it. Do not buy this.
