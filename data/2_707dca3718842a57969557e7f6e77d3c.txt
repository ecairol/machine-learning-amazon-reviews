Good not great but very seviceble at a great price
Great affordable lightweight laptop. The display is just a notch below Apple's Retina at a fraction of the price. Processor and memory is more than adequate for my daily needs (I work online). I do have 1 complaint or it would have 5 not 4 stars.  The touch pad is mediocre at best and extremely annoying at worst. It often won't respond to a repeated tap or a click but other times a finger too close but not touching will generate a click. And forget about the pinch function unless you enjoy frustration getting something sized properly.  All things considered I'm happy with this machine after several weeks of use. But is is so difficult to make a responsive/consistent touch pad?!
