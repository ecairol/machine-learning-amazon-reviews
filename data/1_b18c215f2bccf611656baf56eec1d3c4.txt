cool, and easy to use
Very quiet, cool, and easy to use.However, it does say that it has a 170 degree angle, but it's definitely nowhere near that. It can only angle up to ~130 degrees, which actually bothered me a bit.The fonts on some of the pages, especially demanding pages/apps/etc seem to be blurry and low-quality.For a zenbook, I didn't expect these minor problems to occur.Still, it's literally silent, cool, and has a very long battery life.
