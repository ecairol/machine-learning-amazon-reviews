Sound quality and overall volume pitiful.
Its fine for most features.  Light weight, nice picture, fast enough, etc.  Specifically, though, the sound quality and overall volume is fairly poor.  This is important because it is something that asus specifically advertises as a feature of the this model.  From their website: "High-quality stereo speakers with extra-large audio chambers give performance that surpasses their miniscule size! Crisp, high-fidelity sound can be enjoyed anytime, anywhere with Chromebook."  This is not true.  Not at all.  Sound is no better than my 2 year old outdated samsung chromebook.  Overall volume is surprisingly low.  Plus, the speakers are on the bottom.  That means, when this is sitting in your lap, the speakers are muffled.  What the hell, Asus?  Why not put the speakers right next to the screen, so the sound is projected right at the viewer?  Seems simple enough.  I have contacted Asus about this issue, I'll update this review when I hear from them.Update:  Just heard from Asus.  They got back to me very quickly, but their response, probably automated, was "sorry" and please contact technical support.  Hmm, thought that was what I did.  Won't be spending money on Asus in the future.  If having loud, high quality speakers is not a necessity, then I am sure this chromebook will be fine, but I just purchased the toshiba 13.3" specifically for it's great reviews on loud, high quality speakers.  Check it out.
