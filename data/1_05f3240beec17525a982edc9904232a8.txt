Great for work, video streaming crashes
I bought this at BestBuy, as they had it for $20 less.  It's a great little machine that makes going mobile for a small business owner very easy.  I loaded office and a couple other software apps I use and everything works fine.  My issue is, when streaming video for more than 30 min. it crashes.  It's not a huge issue as I wanted this for work, not movies, but it is a little concerning.  Not sure if others have had the same problem, but I would be hesitant if you wanted this to be your mobile social/entertainment unit.  For work it's great.
