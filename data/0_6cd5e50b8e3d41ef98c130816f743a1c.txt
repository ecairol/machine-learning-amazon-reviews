Getting T-Mobile service activated is apparently IMPOSSIBLE
This has been a bit of a disappointment. I purchased the iPad Air with T-Mobile service directly from Apple, and when I try to set up my account, it informs me that "my zip code is not valid". (It's 95482, which is Ukiah, California, and from the connection indicator on the screen, we do seem to have 4G service here.) I spent 45 minutes on the phone with T-Mobile support to try to resolve this and was informed that I had to spend $10 on a new SIM card, which I did. On receiving the new card, the problem was not resolved. I called support again, and was shuttled from one line to another and finally disconnected. Nobody seemed to know what was going on or how to help me.This is really annoying. I'm a professional software engineer and have a lot of experience with mobile devices, and have never had to deal with this kind of runaround before.Add to that the fact that Safari crashes about once per hour, and I have to say this device is a big, expensive dud. Thin and light, yes, but in every way inferior to the iPad 3 I have already. Overall, a regrettable purchase.
