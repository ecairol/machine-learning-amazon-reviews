Great value for the money.
This is an excellent value for the money, and Asus uses standard industry quality components. It's light and easy to use, but my dad wanted a tablet, so we returned it. But for the few days we had this laptop, I was impressed. I'd buy it again if I was looking for a basic computer undr $300.
