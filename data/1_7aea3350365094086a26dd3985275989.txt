Great NetBook
Great NetBook. I love how reliable it is, but I expect that since it is a Asus product. It's offline capability is limited but if you were looking for something that worked well offline you should not have got a Chrome Book. I boots within seconds and responds fasts to commands. It is very lite weight which makes it easy to Carry around.
