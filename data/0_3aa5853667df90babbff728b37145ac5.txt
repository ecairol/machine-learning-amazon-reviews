You get what you pay for, and I didn't pay much.  The keyboard and touchpad feel flimsy and cheap.  Try to use the touchpad to scroll down a page, and you're more likely to zoom in than scroll down.  The machine runs slower than my old laptop that I had intended to replace.  For an extra computer or for the kids to use, this would be OK.  For primary use, this one just won't cut it.
