Excellent performance at a great price
So far, this Chromebook has been all that I wanted it to be and more. I have used several Chromebooks over the last two years and I was a bit skeptical of the performance of the Rockchip, not being very familiar with the product. But I must say, the chip performs flawlessly and delivers very fast performance at an excellent price. While I'm not a power user by any means, I've found that this Chromebook can handle multiple tasks very easily and there is really very little I can't do with this machine, which has replaced both an aging Apple laptop and a hardly-adequate Windows netbook. While I wish the screen was a touch bigger, for the price, you can't beat it. I just haven't put it through its paces enough to warrant 5 stars, but it's on the way for sure.
