its okay
It is an okay computer if you are looking for a short term use. it is easy to use though its a bit bigger than i expected. it is not heavy at all. I just dont like how the whole thing is black because it is hard for me to see the keyboard clearly in low lighting. this is my first all black computer and i would say the cheapest one. I use it just for typing materials for school and internet stuff. I think it is not quite for gaming if you are planning to buy this for that. i have this computer longer than a month now and i use it everyday. it still works good maybe because i only use it for certain things. If you are looking for a really good cheap laptop this is good enough.
