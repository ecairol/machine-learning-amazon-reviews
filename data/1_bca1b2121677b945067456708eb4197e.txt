Glitchy
It's a good little computer at first. The speakers are awful. Headphones or separate speakers are a must if you want to be able to hear anything well. The keyboard and mouse are already having some glitches, and the computer was purchased 3 months ago. As far as the way it runs otherwise, I would recommend it above the other Chromebooks I have tried. The processing speed is high and there hasn't been a single freeze-up.
