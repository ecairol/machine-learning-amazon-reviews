slow web surfing and internet usage
my web surfing and internet usage on this computer is significantly slower than the last toshiba i had.  my connection is the same and has nothing to do with it.  my other computer, before it broke down, worked fine in terms of web surfing.  this one i just bought now is slow and often lags.  obviously a computer problem.  not very satisfied with this purchase.
