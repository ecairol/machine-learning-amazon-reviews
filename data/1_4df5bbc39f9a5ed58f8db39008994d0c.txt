You get what you pay for!
Purchased this laptop in February 2015, worked great until July 2015. Never used for anything more than Internet surfing and word processing, no downloaded apps, music, movies, etc. Turned it off one night and the next day it would not power back on. Called Asus and they wanted me to pay to send it in to have them check it out. I purchased a new charger thinking maybe my kid got a hold of the original, not the issue. Now, I have no option but take it apart and work on it myself or send it in. Moral of the story, you get what you pay for.****UPDATE****After letting my laptop sit for over a month, I decided to plug it in and try one more time before sending back to ASUS.  To my surprise, it worked! The only thing I can guess is that it needed to completely discharge?? Works well now, for now.  Hopefully it will last a couple more months until I buy a new Macbook.  I adjusted to a 3 star review considering the inconvenience that goes along with not having a laptop for over a month.
