Safari Crashes Constantly
As a MacBook Pro user and Apple supporter, I'm surprised and very disappointed that Safari on my brand-new iPad Air 16G crashes constantly.  It's obviously a known issue, as the discussion boards are filled with similar reports.  This could not have been missed during product testing. Inexcusable.
