Very Disappointing and Terrible Customer Service
I was incredibly disappointed with my Toshiba Chromebook. I bought my Chromebook in April 2015 from Best Buy. I used it probably less than ten times when, 25 days after purchase, the screen stopped working. I never dropped the machine or even moved it from my home desk. Best Buy looked at the Chromebook and said it did not have any evidence of user-caused damage and gave me a number to call Toshiba's customer service so that they could help me fix the issue. I called Toshiba that night and they asked me to send pictures and they would get back to me within 24 hours. I sent the pictures right after getting off the phone. Seven days and numerous contact attempts later, they finally called me back about the issue. They said they would not cover the damage since it was over 14 days since I bought the Chromebook! They said they understood that the damage was not caused by the user but it didn't matter since it was more than 14 days since I purchased the Chromebook.Moreover, I am so disappointed in the customer service I received. The service representatives kept putting me on hold and then sending me to different representatives to talk to. They all said the same thing, that they understood where I was coming from and "would feel the same way" if they were in my shoes, but alas they could not offer anything besides advising me on where to go to take the Chromebook for repairs and that I would have to pay for repairs myself. The Chromebook was sitting on my desk and rarely used. I never even had the chance to use it away from my desk or outside of my apartment. It seems a waste to pay a hundred plus dollars to repair the screen when the machine is obviously just very poorly made. I plan on buying another laptop within the next month but will never buy another Toshiba product again.
