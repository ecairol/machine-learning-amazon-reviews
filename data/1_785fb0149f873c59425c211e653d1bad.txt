GoogleTV one box finally!
Live TV, Netflix, Amazon Instant, HBO Go, AND MY LOCAL SHARES!!!I love this device add a Hulu Plus app (still works through chrome) and it's perfect for me.It can be a little less intuitive than I would like and I have had some "android problems" such as force closes and apps crashing. Luckily I am very familiar with fixing these issues but if my grandmother had this device she would be SOL.All in all GoogleTV extremely undervalued.
