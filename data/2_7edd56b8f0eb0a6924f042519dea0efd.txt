Great laptop
This laptop is super thin and very light. It is also very, very quiet. It boots up within seconds and seems to very fast when surfing the Internet and watching video clips. The On/Off switch is located at the top right row on the keyboard, a bit odd at first, but I really like it. Battery life is very good. It takes about 3 hours to fully charge it and then it lasts for 8-9 hours. Wi-fi setup was very easy! In fact, the entire set-up was completed in less than 5 minutes with no headaches. The screen is very bright and vibrant right out of the box - I had to tweak the settings a bit to tone down the brightness.Just a few negative aspects - the touch pad is annoying, very sensitive and difficult to perform a right-click. I could not see a difference in using the left or right side and got so annoyed with it that I am using a mouse. The keyboard does NOT have a backlight. The case is attractive but easily shows fingerprints. Windows 8.1 is also a pain and takes some getting used to. Aside from that, this is a great laptop.
