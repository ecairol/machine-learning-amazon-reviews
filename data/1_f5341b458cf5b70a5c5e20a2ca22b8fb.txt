love it
yes I love it.  I've had an iphone for years as has the rest of my family.  I have to admit I read all about the new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 and I bought it two weeks ago. the specs were awesome for the price. the only thing is a lot of the things I needed were not compatible with it. then my granddaughter tried to facetime with me and of course I couldn't because  Kindle doesn't have facetime. I told we would both have to download Skype to teleconference with eachother and she said forget it. too much trouble.  then I'd have to buy new extra chargers/cables etc. just too much incompatibility. so I returned it and bought this and I'm thrilled and happy with it. if I wasn't used to Apple products I would have kept the the Kindle. just being honest as I don't want anyone to think that the Kindle wasn't good
