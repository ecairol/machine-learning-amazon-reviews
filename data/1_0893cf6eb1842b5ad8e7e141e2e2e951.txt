good laptop for the even greater price!
I personally am already happy with this laptop pc and I have only had it a couple of hours... it is a major step up from the apple ibook g4 I had been using... however before I had the ibook I had an hp pavilion touchsmart running the same software. I like this one better because It has a cd/dvd drive and a number pad like youd see on most desktop keyboards. this is not a touch screen and that would be the only difference between this and the hp pavilion touchsmart I had.my first impressions when opening the box is that this laptop is HUGE!(in a good way). the keys are easy to see and type on. the dvd drive plays well and doesn't skip. the wifi has a good connection and the usb 2.0 and 3.0 dives are in decent locations.my only complaint is that everything seems to fall to the left of the computer such as the keyboard and mouse.
