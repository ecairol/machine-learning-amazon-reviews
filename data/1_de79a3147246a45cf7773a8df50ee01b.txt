the display is not 1080
if you have bought this computer or even if you are reading reviews you will notice that there are a lot of complaints about the display.now, this laptop is said to have a "1080" display, but that is a lie, this laptop has a 1536x864 pixel display emulating a 1920x1080 display which is what creates the blurry and sometimes hard to read fonts of its too small. but this is not much of a big problem, what is a big problem is that cant possibly run many software that actually require a 1080p display for example if you use autoCAD it wont work on this computer and many other programming or design software wont work.*if you are looking to buy a laptop fit for a real workstation for example your going to college for an engineer major DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP.*but, for anything else its completely fine.
