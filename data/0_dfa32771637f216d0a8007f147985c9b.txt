It seems like a great unit so far
Ordered this laptop for my grandson for school. Received it on October 31. It seems like a great unit so far. Quick loading of programs and powering up. BUT... used only one day then unit would not power back on. No response even with charger plugged in. In the process of sending it back to ASUS for repair (?) which will most likely mean a "refurbished" unit will be sent to us. Quite the frustrating process already with trying to return it. Pretty disappointed in ASUS so far. Wishing we had reviewed this laptop better (other than on Amazon) before purchasing, since after trying to find solutions to the problem online, we are finding this is a common problem with ASUS products.
