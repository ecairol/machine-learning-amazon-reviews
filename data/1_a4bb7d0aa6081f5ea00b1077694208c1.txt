Well Apple you finally got me
I managed to avoid 5 generations of ipad purchases (including the 1st generation mini) but this one finally got me. My eye doctor told me if I didn't stop being ridiculous and using my itouch as an ereader (I know, I know but it was so portable!) I could kiss my 20-20 vision goodbye. Basically Apple can thank my optometrist. That being said this thing is gorgeous. It takes beautiful photos and video, the screen is crisp and clear. While I don't run around in public taking photos and video with it I'm happy it has the capability. It's great for watching movies on the go and I've been very happy with the battery life.So why should you buy this one? It's a reasonable size without sacrificing screen size or quality. I think the ipad mini is cute but I have friends who practically have smartphones with a screen that size. It wasn't worth the price for me. We have other ipad products in my family, I've never been motivated enough to go out and buy my own but this one is a good size. It fits in a normal size bag or purse and makes me feel like I'm carrying around a pad of paper rather than a small laptop.I've had several people ask me why I bought a ipad instead of a kindle fire or the like. As I said, we have a lot of iproducts at my house and I'm very happy with itunes. This way I can easily swap movies, tv shows, ebooks, various apps I need on a daily basis around and basically this has turned into a backup laptop for me. The functionality was absolutely worth it to me.I guess if I were to say anything negative it would be 1) I'm never going to live down finally having bought one after saying I wouldn't for so many years and 2) my iphone and itouch now seem incredibly small. I'm hoping the iphone 6 releases soon and has a bigger screen. First world problems to be sure but there you have it.
