Nice Chromebook
I do like it primarily because it's so fast vs. my Nexus 7. However,they're are some things that initially are irritating me.Primarily it's the lag time when scrolling up a page when surfing the net. I don't know if it's a website issue or the fact that I got the 2G version of memory,but it's an annoyance.Also,I had trouble setting up my Netflix/Chromecast hookup, and contacting Asus...no help. I suspect that english was not their first language. I finally noticed that Netflix had recognized the new device and had set itself up for Chromwcasting.Also,since the system is new,I have some further work to do to combine and recognize my emails on my cable website..so for now,I'm using my Nexus 7 for that(can't throw it away, it was a present).Basically I like it,but since it's my first Chromebook device, there's a learning curve, and I'm sure that time will solve some or all of my issues..maybe I'll even download the 88 page manual from the Asus Website.
