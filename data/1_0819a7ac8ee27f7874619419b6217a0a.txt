it's not a bad little computer
I bought this as a gift for my mom.  For the money, it's not a bad little computer.  If you plan on web browsing and some word documents then it's perfect.  Anything beyond that would require a faster processor.  I'd say it's a good deal for the money.  Kind of a bummer there is no CD drive in it.
