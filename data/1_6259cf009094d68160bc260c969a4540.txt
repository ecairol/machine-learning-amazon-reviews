Worth it!
Bought this for my father-in-law who resides in assisted living, where space is at a premium.  This has a full keyboard plus number pad and best of all, it came loaded with Windows 7 (Windows 8.1 disks were included), so he could use it immediately with little or no learning curve.  Very happy and it was a good price.
