Light and Powerful but had Problem with the Keys Sticking
We love this Chromebook for its boot speed and light weight. But we had problems with the keys sticking after just a few weeks. It got so bad that we had Asus fix it. I'll give credit to Asus for quick response and turnaround, but that kind of major component failure relegates it to 3 stars.
