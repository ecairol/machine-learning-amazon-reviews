Great laptop but needed to tweak default power plan settings
This computer lives up to all the good reviews both on Amazon and online and my rating is more like a 4.5.  I feel the out of the box 'Balanced' power plan settings needed to be tweaked in order to get the CPU usage under control so it didn't run at 100% causing the laptop to get really hot.  This is because the laptop is a fanless design and logic exists to dial back CPU performance in order to lower the temperature when driving it hard causes excess heating (as opposed to traditional laptops that blow forced air over the CPU to cool it).  The changes I made were to the 'Intel Dynamic Platform and Thermal Framework Settings' when editing the advanced power plan options. I set the 'Config TDP Level' to 'Nominal', from the default 'High'.  I set the 'Power Limit' to 3.  Once I tweaked these the computer stayed much cooler under the same usage with no noticeable degradation in performance and experience.
