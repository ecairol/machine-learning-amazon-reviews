Likely Faulty hardware - system date inaccurate
It appears there is a hardware problem in these computers. I wanted to get this review up in case anyone was planning to buy one as a gift this season.The system date randomly changes to a date in the future (anywhere between 1-30 days) after being in sleep mode for a few hours or more. This is the date you see when you unlock the screen, or click on the time to see a calendar. This date is used to create date/time stamp for any files created on the computer. No one wants inaccurate dates on their files and files dated in the future prevent synchronization with cloud storage.I thought it might be 1 bad egg, so I had Amazon send me a 2nd computer, but it has the same problem. Disabling "set time automatically" and setting the time manually does not prevent the date from changing. You can the check/change the date every time you login as an impractical or temporary solution.ASUS support suspects there is a small motherboard battery that is faulty and needs to be replaced. I actually like the laptop a lot, so I'm going to send 1 to ASUS for repair in a 2 week time frame. I should get it back before I have to send the other one back within the 30 day Amazon return window. Hopefully ASUS service corrects the problem on my laptop and the manufacturer eliminates it soon before shipping the product.
