Great Product With some bugs
When I saw the i5 model at 200 dollars off, I had to jump on the offer. It seemed like a great deal, and it most certainly was. I absolutely love the machine. Very attractive, many people even asked my if it was a mac, which shows how well this thing is built. It is also very fast, easily handling word documents and even some casual gaming like Hearthstone. There are some bad things about it thought. There is some issue with the display though, it seems to go black for a few seconds, then comes back and it says that the display driver shuts down, but was recovered. This often happens when I'm watching a video. If anyone knows a solution please reply to this, but besides that, it is a very capable machine for anyone who is doing some light video editing, and a college student would be very pleased with this machine as well.
