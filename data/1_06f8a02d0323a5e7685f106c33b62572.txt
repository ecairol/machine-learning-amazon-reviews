Awesome Computer for the price
This laptop is bottom line fantastic for the price. I thought that the processor could be a little less than I would like but it is plenty quick when surfing the web and navigating through your software. The only slight annoying problem I have noticed is that my graphics card encounters a problem. When this happens, my screen goes black with only the mouse showing for about 3 seconds then everything comes back and a message states that the graphics card encountered an error but has fixed itself. It does no damage to the computer or anything which is running at the time, but it can be annoying. I would say this happens once every few days.Other than that, this laptop is great and if you are looking for a computer in the $500-1000 range, this should be your selection. I am happy I chose this over the Windows Surface 2/3
