Some have said that the screen isn't as bright as they would like. That is an easy fix
I wanted to add a couple of things to some reviews that I have read.  Some have said that the screen isn't as bright as they would like.  That is an easy fix : go to Settings / PC & Devices / Power & Settings, and TURN OFF : Automatically Adjust my Display Brightness.  Even if your display brightness meter is at Full (Highest) setting, it'll get much brighter as soon as you turn that "feature" off.  It'll get even brighter when you plug it into AC.I really, really love this Yoga.  Small form factor, great screen (IPS) and super nice blacks and viewing angles.  Using this in Tent mode is fabulous.  I use it to show people images I have taken and tent mode makes a great "presentation device".For me, this 2 in 1 type of device is perfect.  I can use all my favorite fully fledges Windows applications, and I can use the Modern (Metro) apps and take full advantage of the touch/swipe/gestures that make using a tablet so awesome.I plan to upgrade the hard drive to an SSD so it'll be blazing fast, and I do think the keyboard could be a bit more tactile.  I can type fine and pretty fast, but I'd like just a bit more "click' feel to the keys.I highly recommend this product.  Sure, there are more expensive options out there, but for under 500 bucks, this one is really great.  And if you are thinking of the HP 360 - one look at the displays and you'll pick the Yoga every time.  The HP display is washed out and the viewing angles are not good either.
