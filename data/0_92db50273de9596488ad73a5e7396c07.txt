I am not happy with this product
I am not happy with this product, very misleading. Windows 8 was not installed yet received disc to install but how can you do that when you dont have a disc reader. Also the CPU stayed at 100% all the time which slowed the computer down tremwndously and I now was able to get that under control. I guess you get what you pay for. If my son was not in desperate need I'd return without no hesitation.
