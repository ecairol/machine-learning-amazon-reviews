I give it a "MEH".....I didn't by this because it was a power house but simple browsing, streaming media, and even iTunes just seems to be sluggish. I'm an Asus fan, have been since the mid 90's but this is a bit under powered. Win8.1 has the proc running at a steady 53% utilization right out of the box. The only apps I have installed are iTunes, Firefox, and Office 2010. Hard drive could be bigger too, most of my data is on a QNAP 450 Pro II and working with and opening files/documents is pretty sluggish, even when I copy the files locally and open them it's just a little off the mark as far as performance goes.It will be interesting to see if Win10 works or is better. I will likely have to replace this with something with more juice.Update, this is not a very good ultrabook, I should be able to run at least 2 programs without waiting to switch between screens..I may as well be back in the 90's.
