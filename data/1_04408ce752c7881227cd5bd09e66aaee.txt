Slow.  Probably wouldn't buy again.
I was convinced that I didn't need a faster processor or a lot of memory because all I do is web surf and connect to a remote desktop for work.  This works for me, but if I had it to do over, I'd get something faster.  Sometimes even typing is annoying because it gets behind.  I am also not a fan of the keyboard.  I'm still (after several months) not used to it and have to go back to correct missing letters.  I also get pretty frequent memory warnings, I think due to things running in the background.  Otherwise, the screen is nice, the battery life is great, and it suits my needs fine.  The price was right so I'll live with it now, but I probably wouldn't buy again.
