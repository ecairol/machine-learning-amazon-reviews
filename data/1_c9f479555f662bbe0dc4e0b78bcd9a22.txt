Does the job
Its a nice laptop so far...I accidentally stood on it(long story) but that didnt damage it.  Not suggesting that anyone do that.  The updates and setup takes a little while, but it looks nice and works well.  I needed a new laptop mainly for email, amazon, and fb..and this was a good price and value
