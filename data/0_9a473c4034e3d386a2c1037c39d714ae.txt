if it worked it would be good
This laptop is a nice little laptop. When it works it's great for studying , watch videos and taking notes. The only problem is that the laptop is unstable. I had to return this laptop twice due to the black screen of death that happens randomly in the middle of taking notes! If the laptop actually lasted longer than 2 weeks than I wouldn't have a problem but i can't recommend it as it has to many bugs to be a useable laptop
