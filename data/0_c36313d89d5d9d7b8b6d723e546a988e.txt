Spacebar is HORRIBLE
I wanted an inexpensive laptop to take notes in class and write research papers. The "heaviest" program this laptop can run are the Microsoft Office set of programs. For what I wanted, this computer fulfilled. So why only two stars? What do you imagine is the key that you press the most often as a college student? The spacebar. And this spacebar on this computer is HORRIBLE. Let me emphasize that....H O R R I B L E!I would venture to say the spacebar works, that is to say, produces a space, about 50% of the time. If you're taking notes, and your eyes are on your professor, you look down and your writing is a jarble of long extended words with no spaces, it makes me want to throw my laptop into a wall. When you're writing papers, typing quickly, and keep having to go back over and over and over and add spaces in between words, it makes me want to do a laptop toss. How far can an adult man throw an ASUS 15.6-inch Dual-Core 2.16GHz laptop? Once I have enough money to buy another computer, I will come back on here and let you all know.
