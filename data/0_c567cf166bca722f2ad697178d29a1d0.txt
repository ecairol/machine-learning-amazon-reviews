Very poor customer service
We had this notebook for a MONTH and the screen failed us.  First it was 1 black line in the middle of the screen-then the next day it became most of the screen of colored lines and it gave us about a half an inch to work with.  Tried to call Toshiba for any resolution to get it repaired or replaced, and got absolutely nowhere.  The snarky lady (after being transferred and put on hold many times) just kept apologizing for my "inconvenience" but could not help me since the screen is not under their "limited warranty."  I would not buy this product again. Oh, and if you are outside the first 25 days of buying it, you must pay to talk to a tech. person.  Very poor customer service. Otherwise it is fast if you can get the screen to work.
