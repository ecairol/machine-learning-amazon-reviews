They say you get what you pay for but if that was the case with this computer then it should be sold at around 80 dollars!. Really heavy and clunky, terribly slow and the screen resolution leaves much to be desired. I purchased this for some light office type work but within 30 mins of having received it I was ready to make a return to Amazon. If all computers in this price range are this bad then you should consider spending 50 or 60 more dollars....trust me...it'll be worth it!
