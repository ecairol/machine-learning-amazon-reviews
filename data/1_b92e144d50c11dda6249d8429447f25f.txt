this machine is just fine for poking around the web
I bought this direct from Microsoft just before Christmas for $200.  For the price, I didn't expect to be impressed, and I wasn't let down.  Overall, this machine is just fine for poking around the web.  But the trackpad is just stupid.  The buttons are integrated into the bottom of the trackpad so that you can't press either of them without moving the pointer on the screen.  Bad, stupid over-design of a computer component that was figured out twenty years ago.
