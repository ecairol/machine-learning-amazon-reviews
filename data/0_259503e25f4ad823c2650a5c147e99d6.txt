Had highest hopes on this laptop. But the display quality on this laptop is worst. The screen doesn't even compete with a $400 laptop. The hardware on this laptop is impressive but the screen quality is terrible. I am not sure if I wan't to use this laptop anymore. I wish there is a settings change to get a better display.
