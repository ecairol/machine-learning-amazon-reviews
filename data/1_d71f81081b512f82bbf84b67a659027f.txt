I love the chromebook concept
I love the chromebook concept.  Perfect for internet surfing!!!!One word of caution: if you are going to be working in a dark room, suggest get a model with backlighting on keys.  Other than that, I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this purchase.  I plan on waiting about 6 or 9 months, then getting another chromebook with (you guessed it) back lighting on the keyboard.The ASUS brand has always done me well on my electronic purchases.
