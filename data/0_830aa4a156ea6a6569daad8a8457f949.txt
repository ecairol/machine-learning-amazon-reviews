TouchPad is terrible. I have searched every possible solution and tried to talk to Dell - but no fixes are working. I have changed my settings as suggested - still not fixed. I strongly urge you to re-consider buying this machine! Most issues are intermittent, which makes it more irritating. For example trying to right (or left) click does not work, pointer moves, unable to R click and copy, trying to highlight a word is not accurate, the list goes on and on. I have owned Dell computers in the past - but this problem is awful!!
