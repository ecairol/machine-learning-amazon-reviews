Crippled by poor video drivers.  ASUS does not have a fix.
Form factor is good, as is build quality.  What isn't so good are the frequent windows display driver crashes.  Something wonky with the video processor and or drivers.  Search Google...it's not just mine, and it's not just once in a rare while that it happens.This could be a great machine.  But constant video driver crashes and resets get old quickly.  Spend your money elsewhere.
