Can I have my $800 back, please??
Needed a lightweight laptop for work and school, and something reliable for multiple uses with ability to project multimedia to a second monitor for regular multitasking I rely on to cut my work time down radically (a third to a half). Purchased for speed, multitasking and light weight. Sadly the video experience and second monitor projection have failed. Display has crumpled, driver has stopped periodically and finally the VGA signal to second monitor stopped (I've tried two separate monitors). All this in the first six weeks of ownership. On hold with support right now (five minutes and counting), hoping they will provide an immediate resolution or replace the Zenbook with something better or at least not broken? I doubt this is an issue with my specific laptop, though. Reading through chats, I see many other owners have experienced the same or similar.
