Disappointing
Pretty awful. 90% of the computer requires Internet but there seems to be connection issues with in the laptop. I also have an iPad and it doesn't have any issues with my high-speed wireless Internet. I've googled numerous different things to try to remedy the issue but nothing seems to work. What's the point of having an Internet-based laptop if you can't connect to the Internet?
