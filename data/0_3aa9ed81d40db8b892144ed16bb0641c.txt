The laptop looks nice and it is light
The laptop looks nice and it is light. However, the battery life is nowhere near as advertised. Also, it has issues with the touchpad where it randomly becomes unresponsive even if all the updates are installed. In fact, this is what happened just now where it froze and I am unable to right-click on the pad. Honestly, my old Dell - that I bought in 2009 - is/was a lot better quality than this.Last not but not least - I bought it refurbished and somehow it came registered under someone else's name. Dell advised me to contact the seller to change it but they never responded. Without the name change, Dell has refused on ocassions to provide technical support on the touchpad issues, which is very frustrarting.I am returning this after spending nearly 3 months messing around with the touchpad.
