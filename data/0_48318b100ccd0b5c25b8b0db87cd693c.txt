Don't buy this.
Just don't buy this. It was a complete waste of money. Every time I use it, my WiFi disconnects and it says "out of range". I could be right on top of my router. It's very inconvenient and convenience is what I was looking for. I'm actively selling this on Craigslist. There's probably a way better product out there.
