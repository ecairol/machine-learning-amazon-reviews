No Wifi connection after 5 months.
My chromebook worked for first 5 months and then stopped connecting with WIFI. Sent back to ASUS, and they repaired it. Worked for one week and then stopped again. Sent it back second time for repair--just received it and it does not work (same problem). Called them, and I now have to send it back a third time, and they may give me a replacement. The customer service rep I spoke with (who was very nice) was not authorized to send a replacement. Will re-post if they send replacement. At this point would not recommend ASUS chromebook.
