Great for grad school, died three days in, but still totally recommend because of Amazon's policies
Summary: This is awesome for a student. Their quality control is a mess and you may get a total dud, BUT Amazon has totally got your back and you won't lose any money, so I would still recommend going for it if you need a good computer for super cheap.I am a grad student who mostly needed this computer for taking notes, writing papers, and having internet access. It absolutely worked for that. Dealing with it not having the usual Word was going to be a bit of a pain, but pretty easy to solve (google docs, online Word, and having access to the computer lab when I really needed it). Overall, it was fast, easy to use, lightweight, and took care of 90% of my needs. For the price, this computer was absolutely perfect and I was so happy with it.And then it died three days after I bought it. The trackpad completely stopped working and I couldn't use it for anything. Argh!However, Amazon made this still absolutely worth buying. I contacted them and had a completely painless returns process where they took care of everything and I wasn't out any money. I don't think this makes it much less of a good buy. From what I can tell, there just aren't laptops/chromebooks  that are this cheap and don't have some problems with quality control. So, be prepared that you may get a dud on the first go. I don't know if this translates into being more likely to die early too, but I know my last $400 computer died one year and two days after I bought it (so right after the warranty expired), so I'm really not convinced that bumping up a couple hundred more will get you a better chance at a long-lasting buy.So! I would still absolutely recommend this laptop if you're looking for a cheap, portable, happy-to-use computer, just be prepared for some hassle.
