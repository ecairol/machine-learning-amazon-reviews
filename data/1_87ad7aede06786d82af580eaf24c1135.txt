I love it!
Update on the microphone problem.I probably fixed it by plugging in and removing an external mike/headset. That exersizes the internal contacts. Also found and installed a Realtek sound application. http://support.toshiba.com/support/viewContentDetail?contentId=4007927&pf;=true. It gives you lots of control over the audioOK day 3. Update to Windows 10.x went great. Sound is fine. Use the equalizer. It's a laptop not a boom box! ( if you are old enough to remember what a boom box is?) Performance is great. only 1 problem so far. I CAN NOT GET THE INTERNAL MICROPHONE TO WORK.
