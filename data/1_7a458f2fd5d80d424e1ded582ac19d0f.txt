Gets all the major things RIGHT - Best overall chromebook (as of Oct 2014)
Quick summary:Pros: (gets all the major things right)Full HD 1080p IPS screen (no other chromebook currently has IPS at this resolution)Good battery life (7-9 hrs expected depending on usage) (edit: have 62% remaining after 3+ hrs of use at 50-60% brightness)trackpad/keyboard/scrolling works wellSD card pretty flush when inserted4GB RAM helps with having multiple tabs open (although CPU limits what can be going on - would not try simultaneous streaming of music, movies, youtube, etc.....you will likely get stuttering)Built-in keyboard speakers (Skullcandy branded) better than bottom-based speakers in general (although speakers on most laptops are never that great so don't get your expectations up to get a "home theater" experience or anything like that)Cons: (all minor in my eyes)Performance (not as good as Haswell processors - Celeron 2955U or Core i3, but better than ARM-based Exynos in Samsung)Power brick cord may be "too" long and brick itself gets quite hotscaling issue (mitigated by either changing settings or doing the Beta channel trick mentioned in other reviews)***possible Quality Control issues?*** (see below)i would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product for features and value.  i am upgrading from a samsung XE303 (2012) 11" chromebook.i received my chromebook 2 (CB35-B3340) yesterday and have put in a good 3-4 hours of usage playing SD card videos, youtube videos in 1080p, listened to google play music, lots of internet surfing, etc.  i love this machine!  i listed the pros/cons above and won't try to cover all the bases that the more in-depth reviewers have done (great reviews by the way).  The Cons are all minor in my eyes....the quality control issue i mentioned is that one of the rubber feet on the base was missing (appears to have fallen off somehow) and was nowhere to be found in the packaging.  no big deal and i will just ask Toshiba to send me a new one that i can glue on, but still may indicate some supply chain inspection issues...who knows.  Regardless, the display makes this machine so worth it and the Bay Trail performance is not as bad as i feared (although i would not call myself a "power user").  i read in a comment on a online review (not Amazon) that it does not play back in 1080p and that is not true - It does and it looks great!  The $330 price point is great value and i would buy it again (missing rubber feet and all).
