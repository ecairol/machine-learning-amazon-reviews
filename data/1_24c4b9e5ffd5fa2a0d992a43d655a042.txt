and I've had a lot of other dumb issues with it
It's okay for what it is, and what it costs. It tends to freeze a lot, and I've had a lot of other dumb issues with it, but you get what you pay for I suppose.  Go elsewhere if you have the extra funds though.  It has caused me a lot of stress and grief.  Traveling out to coffee shops and I can't even hook up to the internet while my wife is on here macbook with no issues.
