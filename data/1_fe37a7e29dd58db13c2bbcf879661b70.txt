Nice portable laptop. But not perfect and not upgradable.
Pros.- Decent IPS screen.- Light weight and long battery hour (for me +6 hour is enough)- Crouton works pretty well. Xfce version has some problem but Unity version works well.Cons.- Weak CPU (Just barely tolerable)- No delete key (I use this key a lot)- Function key number is not printed on the keyboard.- Keyboard is just so so.On the second day, I already opened the case to check its upgradabiliy.No upgrade is allowed, it is a simply one-board laptop (except WLAN card)I have used more than 20 different laptops models, but this one is pretty unique.I just learned 13.3 laptop is not large enough for daily use, which made me decide to buy a 15inch macbook next year.
