Great Addition
This is a fantastic tool to augment your other devices. This goes with me to work along with my company issued laptop for research and other various net related activities. Its light and compact enough that it does not feel like an additional burden to carry around. If you have embraced the Google model this will fit right in and you will love its simplicity and near complete integration with other Google products. You can run Ubuntu using crouton on this device, and for the price the performance is fantastic.
