Great purchase, very happy with it
I purchased the Windows 10 core 5 laptop and is very happy with it.I do not experience over-hot issue like the other reviews do. I had more than three hours now and it is cool, not even warm.It is very light, good looking and great keyboard to type.Download is fast and streaming is smooth.I still likes Windows 7 better but well life moves on.My only complain is the screen display seems a bit too green than other screens I have used. But I can probably adjust it somewhere.Overall very good machine and highly recommend.
