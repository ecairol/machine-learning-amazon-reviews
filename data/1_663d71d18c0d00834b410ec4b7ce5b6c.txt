Excellent laptop. I was able to homegroup with my desktop PC very easily. Sound volume is somewhat weak and was my only negative. Otherwise I don,t understand some of the negative reviews here like retains fingerprints on tne case etc.  My router is in the basement of my 2 story home and I can go to any part of the house and still have connectivity. I purchased a bluetooth mouse and an external DVD burner from here at Amazon and I can now do just about anything on this laptop to what I ordinarily do on my PC. One other note, I was able to sync my password software to this laptop which further simplified my online activity. Four stars because of the weak sound.
