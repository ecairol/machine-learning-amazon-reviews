Nice but had some glitches
This chromebook is very fast.  I bought 2 at the time of purchase, this one and an acer.  For the most part, this one feels more durable and even a little quicker.  I ended up returning this one for another acer after using it for just a few days.  It works fine most of the time.  However, facebook and youtube both cause it to lock up.  The screen will freeze and the chromebook with become unresponsive.  Then it goes black and when it comes back up, you need to close the window.  I do not keep a dozen tabs open at once.  This would happen with only 1 or 2 tabs open.  I do not know if if did in on other websites, because I returned it.  I thought about requesting another one b/c it could have been that particular device and not all c201s.  Instead, I went with another acer.
