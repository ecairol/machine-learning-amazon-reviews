So for the money, it's a decent computer.  It's for my daughter, who is 14, and she doesn't need anything fancy.  She won't take care of it anyway!  It is kind of clunky looking and not the sleek-and-slim, newer body style.  No touch screen.  It's the larger size laptop, which she likes.  No backlit keys.  To look at it you would think it was heavy.  It really isn't!  The shell is not smooth, it has a texture to it.  Two USB ports, one HDMI, an old-looking port for a monitor.  So for $250 bucks, you can't beat it in my opinion.
