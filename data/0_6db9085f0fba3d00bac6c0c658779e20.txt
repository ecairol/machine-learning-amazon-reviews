The Computer is great when it powers up.....
This device stopped powering up after I had the device for 3 weeks. I contacted Lenovo Support and I had to send my laptop in and they allegedly repaired it and sent it back (I was without the device for approximately 3 weeks). 3 months later my device is doing the same thing that they claimed they repaired. The device is great when it's working. However, the process to get the device repaired is a nightmare. Do not purchase this device without purchasing an additional warranty plan.
