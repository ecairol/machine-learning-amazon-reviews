not a bad laptop, but no manual included
i like the laptop, but was very disappointed that there was NO user manual included with the purchase.....if you knew nothing of computers you would have been lost. i have had a laptop from my work and a lot of the settings migrated once i logged into my accounts, but a novice user wouldn't have that luxury.OK, after spending some time using the laptop i finally found a "E-Manual" which has all the operating instructions. i was looking for a paper manual, but this seems to have everything you need to learn the unit.
