1) Lighter than macbook air2) Faster than macbook air3) Great great great spec at a very very genuine price4) Color (I got golden) is sexy5) Keyboard is great as well6) Trackpad responds really nice (gives the mac feel)Only flaw so far, is that I the power button is placed placed on the keyboard next to delete button. I pressed a few times by mistake and that makes my computer sleep. Although it can be configured to "do nothing" in the control panel. Having said that, i consider this not as a flaw but a major design blunderI am going to comeback to write na updated review after a few days of use.
