I like it! Sucky touch pad though
So far I like the laptop.  I've had it for about a week.  I do see an issue with the touch pad which is why I bumped this down to a 3 star (I know many people like using touch pad..  Sometimes I the cursor will not move when I use it but generally I use a wireless mouse so this doesn't bug me too much.  It plays CSGO pretty well and starts up really fast.  I will update if anything major changes.
