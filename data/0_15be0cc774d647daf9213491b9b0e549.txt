BestPTV send me an infected machine
I like the product - it has all the advantages of a notebook and a tablet.  BUT....This machine was riddled with malware from the first day I had it.  But I didn't realize it at first and all of my accounts were compromised.  It ships with a trial version of McAfee but for whatever reason, that didn't work to protect the machine.  I've now gotten it cleaned up with malwarebytes and installed my own subscription to Norton.  But all my passwords - at least the ones I used while the machine was infected - were compromised.  I was locked out of FB and my email account.  I even paid bills with my bank account while it was infected and had to change my password and freeze my account.
