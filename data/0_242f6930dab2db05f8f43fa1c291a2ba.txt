NO DISC DRIVE TO INSTALL WINDOWS 8 DISC
would have given better rate but...it came with windows seven installed the claim 8 would be install aswell...well it has windows 8 disk but  what u dont notice is it doesnt have a disc drive installed either so  what good are the  discs to install 8 if the no  disc drive to do it with other then that so far it works just fine if u r fine using windows 7
