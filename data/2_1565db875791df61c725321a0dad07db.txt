Perfect for me, once I got the touchpad disabled
I'm not a heavy gaming user, so the i5 processor was a step up over my old i3, and not as expensive as the i7. 256 GB is perfect for me, since I keep most of my stuff (books, music, movies, etc) in the cloud. SSD means it's super thin and doesn't need a fan.But gold? It does look more silver to me, if that matters.Oh! Just as an FYI, once I put in my USB mouse, I didn't want the touchpad to be active anymore. The FN+F9 option didn't work at all. I checked the Asus website, and didn't find anything there about disabling the touchpad (except the fn+f9). However, other users talked about turning it off through the "Smart Gestures" software that Asus uses to manage their touchpad. My computer didn't have this software and I was having trouble downloading it from the Asus website. (I am a fan of Asus computers, but I have to say their website sucks if you're looking for support.) When my computer did a second round of Windows Updates, the software was now available on the task bar. I went into the options and checked the box that says "turn off the touchpad when a mouse is connected" and it works perfectly :)
