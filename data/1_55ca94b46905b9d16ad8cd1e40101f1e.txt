ASUS support is misleading but the machine is excellent
The notebook is absolutely perfect and fast enough for light (student) use however in the question and answer section someone from ASUS was posting a misleading information about this particular laptop, this machine doesn't have CD/DVD player but the representative from ASUS was telling people it comes with one. That is ASUS fault not the sellers since they didn't post it as if it's equipped with one.
