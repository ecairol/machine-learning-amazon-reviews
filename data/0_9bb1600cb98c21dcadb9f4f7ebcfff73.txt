You get what you pay for
If you want a basic machine for Facebook and email, this is for you. But if you want to do any more than that, I'd aim higher. Out of the box, this laptop was far slower than any brand new laptop should be, and I'm not sure if it's "a windows 8 thing" or the system specs.Granted I'm not up on laptop specs, but it didn't seem that bad on paper. Using it, however, was a different story. I own a mid-range ASUS laptop in addition to this and there's a big difference.
