good performance in a small package
The Asus ZenBook UX305 is a nice lightweight laptop for general everyday computer use. It works well for using office suites, browsing the internet, and other less intensive programs. It uses an Intel i5 processor and eights gigs of ram with the solid state hard drive boot. It also comes with Windows 10 which makes a package with very quick boot times. It takes about five seconds to reach the windows nlogin screen from a powered off state. The screen is 1080p and looks clear and vibrant. The touch pad is quick and responsive. The speakers are adequate for such a small package. The ZenBook also  is fairly quiet during use. Overall the Asus ZenBook UX305 is an extremely nice lightweight package for everyday use.
