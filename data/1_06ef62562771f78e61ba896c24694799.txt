an OK buy
this is an inexpensive laptop, with dual core celeron, I have not had slowness or connectivity problem; it is slightly heavy for its size in today's market, considering that this model has no CD-ROM, but for lightness you need to pay a bit more; I also found having to log into a microsoft account just to start the machine rather annoying, especially as this means my actions are easily identified and monitored, but this is a windows 8 things not the fault of asus; overall, it is an OK kind of buyI point out that the battery is not removable, and when it breaks, you will have to send the machine in to rectify it, and this will probably cost more than the machine is worth by then; I also point out there are various other X551 models out there at various prices, depending on whether they have faster processors, CD-ROM, etc; some older models still have single core CPUs; so you need to carefully choose the particular model for your needs
