Disappointing performance...
I bought this machine after reading the great reviews here on Amazon. I was hoping that with all the praise from the gamers that I would at least be able to run Photoshop on it. Sadly the machine is not up to the task.  I guess it's ok in the other areas as far as speed of loading start pages and documents and such, but not anything that may require a little more RAM.  I could have bought a different brand with the same specs for several hundred dollars less....
